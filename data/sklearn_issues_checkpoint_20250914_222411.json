      "title": "Trees: impurity decrease calculation is buggy when there are missing values",
      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nIn decision trees (both classif. and regression), the impurity decrease calculation is sometimes wrong when there are missing values in X.\n\nThis can lead to unexpectedly shallow trees when using `min_impurity_decrease` to control depth.\n\nThis was discovered by investigations started by this issue: #32175\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```Python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\nX = np.vstack([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n]).swapaxes(0, 1).astype(float)\ny = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nn_leaves = []\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=1, min_impurity_decrease=0.25).fit(X, y)\n    # all the trees have two leaves\n    assert tree.tree_.n_leaves == 2\n\nX[X == 0] = np.nan\nn_leaves_w_missing = []\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=1, min_impurity_decrease=0.25).fit(X, y)\n    n_leaves_w_missing.append(tree.tree_.n_leaves)\n\nprint(np.bincount(n_leaves_w_missing))\n# prints [0 ~500 ~500]\n```\n\nThe last print shows that in approx. half of the cases, the tree has only one leaf (i.e. no split).\n\n### Expected Results\n\nChaning 0 by nan should have no impact on the tree construction in this example.\n\nThe tree should always have one split (and hence two leaves).\n\n### Actual Results\n\nIn approx. half of the cases, the tree has only one leaf (i.e. no split).\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    python: 3.12.11 (main, Aug 18 2025, 19:19:11) [Clang 20.1.4 ]\nexecutable: /home/arthur/dev-perso/scikit-learn/sklearn-env/bin/python\n   machine: Linux-6.14.0-29-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.39\n\nPython dependencies:\n      sklearn: 1.8.dev0\n          pip: None\n   setuptools: 80.9.0\n        numpy: 2.3.3\n        scipy: 1.16.2\n       Cython: 3.1.3\n       pandas: None\n   matplotlib: 3.10.6\n       joblib: 1.5.2\nthreadpoolctl: 3.6.0\n\nBuilt with OpenMP: True\n\nthreadpoolctl info:\n       user_api: blas\n   internal_api: openblas\n    num_threads: 16\n         prefix: libscipy_op...",

This might be especially useful for outlier detection models such as `IsolationForest`.\n\nRelated to #15796.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\n\nExtend the `categories` option to have:\n\n- `categories=\"lexigraphical\"` (default for backward compat);\n- `categories=user_provided_list` (same as today);\n- `categories=\"frequency\"` (the new option).\n\nIf `categories=\"frequency\"`, then the generated category encodings would be:\n\n- 0 would encode the most frequent category observed in the training set,\n- 1 the second most frequent,\n- ...\n- and so on until the least frequent categories.\n\nTie breaking could be based on the lexicographical order to ensure that the behavior of `OrdinalEncoder` remains invariant under a shuffling of the rows of the training set.\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n- Use `TargetEncoder` that leverages some frequency info (mixed with the mean value of the target variable), but this is a supervised method and would therefore not be suitable for unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, for instance.\n\n- Introduce a new dedicated class, e.g. `FrequencyEncoder`.\n  - pro: allow using the observed relative frequency (between 0 and 1) as value (but would collapse equally frequent categories into the same numerical value).\n  - con: introduces yet another estimator class in our public API.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Specifically, FeatureUnion concatenates outputs of its transformers before the set_output wrapper renames columns based on get_feature_names_out. This works fine with pandas but causes issues with polars since polars does not allow creating a DataFrame with duplicate column names. This leads to errors when using FeatureUnion with polars outputs.\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nThe documentation should mention the behavior difference when using FeatureUnion with polars DataFrames, specifically that concatenation occurs before column renaming. This can cause duplicate column names errors in polars.\n\nIt would be helpful to add a warning or note about this limitation, and suggest possible workarounds, such as manually renaming columns or converting to pandas DataFrame before using FeatureUnion.\n\nIncluding a minimal example demonstrating the issue and how to avoid it would further improve clarity for users.",

The standard practice is to use one-hot encoding before applying algorithms like K-Means.\n\nThis workflow is problematic because:\n1.  **High-Dimensionality:** It drastically increases the dimensionality of the dataset (the \"curse of dimensionality\").\n2.  **Sparsity:** It creates a sparse matrix that is computationally inefficient and poorly suited for distance-based algorithms like K-Means, which are designed for dense, numerical data.\n3.  **Interpretability:** The resulting clusters are based on a transformed version of the data, making the centroids and the cluster logic difficult to interpret in terms of the original categorical features.\n\nThe workflow I want to enable is a seamless and native experience for clustering categorical and mixed data:\n*   **For fully categorical data:** A user should be able to call `KModes(n_clusters=5).fit(X_categorical)` directly, without any pre-processing.\n*   **For mixed data types:** A user should be able to call `KPrototypes(n_clusters=5, categorical=[0, 2]).fit(X_mixed)`, where they simply specify which columns are categorical. The algorithm would then automatically use an appropriate dissimilarity measure for each data type.\n\nThis integrates categorical clustering directly into the robust and familiar scikit-learn API, eliminating the need for external dependencies and inefficient pre-processing.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI propose implementing the well-established K-Modes and K-Prototypes algorithms as new classes within the `sklearn.cluster` module. These algorithms are the canonical equivalents of K-Means for categorical and mixed data, respectively.\n\n**Proposed API Design (following scikit-learn conventions):**\n\n```python\nclass KModes(BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin):\n    \"\"\"\n    K-Modes clustering for categori...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nI aim to enable a more efficient training workflow for Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in scikit-learn by optimizing the performance of the `SGDOptimizer` and `AdamOptimizer` classes. Currently, these optimizers use list comprehensions in their `_get_updates` methods to compute parameter updates, which can be computationally expensive for large neural networks with many parameters (e.g., hidden layers with thousands of neurons). The proposed vectorized operations will allow users to train larger MLPs faster, particularly on datasets requiring extensive iterations, without altering the existing API or user experience. Additionally, the optimization will address redundant computations in `SGDOptimizer` when using Nesterov’s momentum, further improving training speed. This enhancement will benefit users working on deep learning tasks within scikit-learn, such as image classification or regression with complex models, by reducing training time and improving scalability.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nTo optimize the performance of `SGDOptimizer` and `AdamOptimizer`, I propose the following changes to `sklearn/neural_network/_stochastic_optimizers.py`:\n\n1. **Vectorized Operations**:\n   - Replace list comprehensions in `_get_updates` with in-place NumPy vectorized operations. This will leverage NumPy’s optimized C-based implementation, reducing Python loop overhead. For example, in `AdamOptimizer._get_updates`, the current list comprehension for updating first and second moments can be replaced with a single vectorized operation across all parameters.\n   - Example implementation for `AdamOptimizer._get_updates`:\n ```python\n\ndef _get_updates(self, grads: List[np.ndarray]) -> List[np.ndarray]:\n         self.t += 1\n         lr_t = self.learning_rate_init * np.sqrt(1 - self.beta_2**self.t) / (1 - self.beta_1**self.t)\n         for m, v, grad in zip(self.ms, self.vs, grads):\n             np.multiply(self.beta_1, m, out=m)\n     ...",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWhen using `pytest-xdist` with several workers to run a test suite that uses `fetch_20newsgroups` as a fixture (`scope=\"session\") the dataset shape is sometimes wrong. For example I just had a run where `X.shape=(5902, 68435) y.shape=(5902,)` - it should be something like ~11000 samples for the \"train\" subset.\n\nSome test functions will see the \"shorter\" dataset and some the full dataset.\n\nI think the problem is caused by using `pytest-xdist` where each worker will download the dataset itself. The download itself will work in parallel (though wasteful) but then when the file gets `shutil.move`d to the final location things get broken? Or one of the workers sees a partial file somehow.\n\nThis is the relevant code\n\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/be9dd4d4c1f03b8d27311f2d43fcb3c88bdea55c/sklearn/datasets/_base.py#L1499\n\nI'm wondering if the fix is to not use `NamedTempFile` to create the filename to download to, but instead use a name like `fname + '.part'` and check if that file exists before starting a download. That way only one process would start downloading the file.\n\nThe problem is that we would need a `check_or_create(path)` function that will perform the check and creation of a path in an atomic operation. Not sure that exists :-/\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\nIf you put this snippet into a file and run it with `python your_file.py <n_procs>` it reproduces a different version (I think) of the problem.\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing as mp\nimport random\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n\n\ndef fetch_data(i):\n    time.sleep(random.random())\n    data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\"train\", shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n    return (i, len(data.data))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n_processes = int(sys.argv[1])\n\n    with mp.Pool(processes=n_processes) as pool:\n        results = pool.map(fetch_data, range(n_processes))\n    print(results)\n```\n\nMake sure to delete the 20newsgroups file(s) fro...",

Maybe the intercept should be separated as `intercepts_paths_`.\n- `scores_` is a dictionary with class labels as keys and arrays of shape (n_folds, n_cs) or similar as values. All values are the same regardless of the key (class label). This is a relict from OvR.\n  A good value would be just an array of shape (n_folds, n_cs)\n- `C_` is an array of shape (n_classes)\n  As the different penalties for classes are gone with the removal of OvR, `C_` should be a single float: the single best penalty parameter.\n- `l1_ratio_` same as `C_`\n- `n_iter_` is an array of shape (1, n_folds, n_cs) or similar\n  The first dimension should be removed, i.e. shape (n_folds, n_cs)\n\n### Deprecation strategy\nIt is unclear to me how to accomplish the above. Options:\n1. Deprecate old attributes and introduce new ones with new names. (time = 2 releases)\n2. Same as 1. but then deprecate new ones and reintroduce the old names. (time = 4 releases)\n3. Deprecate old attributes and switch behavior in after the deprecation cycle (time = 2 releases)\n4.

      "body": "### Describe the issue linked to the documentation\n\nThe documentation for the `dcg_score` and `ndcg_score` leave much to be desired.\n\nI believe this is also a by-product of competing definitions of the discount cumulative gains (DCG) and normalised DCG (nDCG) in literature. Namely\n\n$$\\mathrm{DCG_{p}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}(i+1)}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\mathrm{DCG_{p}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\frac{ 2^{rel_{i}} - 1 }{ \\log_{2}(i+1)}.$$\n\n\nThe `dcg_score` uses the former definition, I do not think this is very clear.\n\nThe description for the DCG score (`dcg_score`) says \"Sum the true scores ranked in the order induced by the predicted scores, after applying a logarithmic discount\". While this is technically correct to what `dcg_score` does, like many maths equations, it is hard to understand without using maths notation.\n\nIf a user wants to clarify the exact equation of the DCG used past the description they might go to the references, however,\n\n- the first reference is the Wikipedia which offers both definitions;\n\n- the third reference, \"Wang, Y., Wang, L., Li, Y., He, D., Chen, W., & Liu, T. Y. (2013, May). A theoretical analysis of NDCG ranking measures. In Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2013)\", defines the discount function an a much more general way. While interesting does not give the user any insight into how the `dcg_score` is actually implemented.\n\nMy criticism of the `ndcg_score` is the same.\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nI would propose giving an explicit definition of the DCG along the lines of\n\n$$\\mathrm{DCG_{k}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{rel_{i}}{\\log_{2}(i+1)}$$\n\nwhere each $rel_i$ is the true score ranked in the order induced by the predicted scores.\n\nAlso, to do something similar for the `ndcg_score`.",

Due to its empirical performance, inclusion in scikit-learn would be a welcome addition for practitioners as it is vastly superior to most clustering algorithms currently included in scikit learn (on non-trivial datasets).\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI propose to include the Leiden algorithm as a clustering algorithm in scikit-learn.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n[From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z)",

For example above I might want to invest more computation time in the \"not passthrough\" branch. Or if I have a column that can be either dropped or transformed I may want to explore more the \"not drop\" branch.\n\nIn other cases we have to create multiple list items due to nested estimators but that results in one choice for a hyperparameter to be over-represented. For example:\n\n```python\n[\n    {\n        \"transformer\": Flat(),\n        \"transformer__a\": uniform(0.0, 1.0),\n        \"transformer__b\": uniform(0.0, 1.0),\n    },\n    {\n        \"transformer\": Nested(),\n        \"transformer__part\": A(),\n        \"transformer__part__a\": uniform(0.0, 1.0),\n    },\n    {\n        \"transformer\": Nested(),\n        \"transformer__part\": B(),\n        \"transformer__part__b\": uniform(0.0, 1.0),\n    },\n]\n```\n\nI have to create 2 grid items for the Nested() option but if I am equally interested in the Flat() one I might want to set weights [1.0, 0.5, 0.5] on the list of param dicts. Maybe this is not a great example but what I mean is the amount of trials spent on one option can be driven by the structure of the estimators and how they are combined and sometimes it would be helpful to be able to correct or control it.\n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nNot sure what could be a nice API, maybe there would be a `distribution_weights` parameter which can only b...",

These NaN values are then passed to the SciPy function, which in turn calls the LAPACK gesdd routine for SVD, causing it to crash.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression\n\nn_samples = 20\ny = np.arange(n_samples, dtype=float)\n\n# This feature has zero variance.\nX = np.ones((n_samples, 1))\n\n# This will raise the error.\npls = PLSRegression(n_components=1)\npls.fit(X, y)\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nThe model should either fit successfully (e.g., perhaps assigning a zero weight to the zero-variance feature) or raise a more informative ValueError indicating that a predictor has zero variance.\n\n### Actual Results\n\nWe get \"ValueError: illegal value in 4th argument of internal gesdd\"\n\n```python\n/home/user/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/cross_decomposition/_pls.py:99: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n  y_weights = np.dot(Y.T, x_score) / np.dot(x_score.T, x_score)\n/home/user/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/cross_decomposition/_pls.py:368: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n  x_loadings = np.dot(x_scores, Xk) / np.dot(x_scores, x_scores)\n/home/user/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/cross_decomposition/_pls.py:377: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n  y_loadings = np.dot(x_scores, yk) / np.dot(x_scores, x_scores)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/user/agents/test/f.py\", line 14, in <module>\n    pls.fit(X, y)\n    ~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/user/.local/lib/python3.13/site-p...",

Scope what needs to be audited/tested - and update this issue to reflect this\n2. Test/audit components and report back on the findings in this issue\n3. Iteratively work on any remediation tasks as needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions on how to approach this more effectively, so we can keep you all aligned and ensure a smooth contribution. \n\nAlso, if y'all can assign me to this issue, it would be great! ✨",

Also see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31728\n\nMore background: Currently, every time `scikit-learn` releases a new minor version - e.g., 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0 - compliant extensions, e.g., custom transformers, classifiers, etc, break - specifically, referring to the API conformance as tested through `check_estimator` or `parametrize_with_checks`.\n\nThese repeated breakages in the \"extender contract\" contrast the stability of the usage contract, which is stable and professionally managed.\n\nFor a package like `scikit-learn` which means to be a standard not just for ML algorithms but also an API standard that everyone uses, this is not a good state to be in - \"do not break user code\" is the maxim that gets broken for power users writing extensions.\n\nOf course maintaining downwards compatibility is not always possible, but nothing should break without a proper warning.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nThe `fit`/`_fit` separation would ensure stability of the extension contract - and would also allow to build secondary deprecation patterns in relation to it.\n\nThe (oop) pattern this would implement is the so-called \"template pattern\".\n\nIt would allow to remove likely changing parts such as the boilerplate (e.g., `validate_data` vs `_validate_data` and such) from the extension locus, and thus completely prevent breakage in relation to boilerplate changes.\nReference: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method\n\nExamples of how this can be used to improve stability:\n\n* `sktime`, for a different API, has a separation between `fit` calling an internal `_fit`, where change-prone boilerplate is sandwiched between a stable user contract (`fit`) and a stable extender contract (`_fit`); similarly `pr...",

I have questions about both of them.\n\n** (Edited) Summary **\nTroubles with the current code normalization:\n- In the dense affinity_matrix case, the current code sums axis=0 and then divides the rows by these sums. Other normalizations in semi_supervised use axis=1 (as this case should). This does not cause incorrect result so long as we have symmetric affinity_matrices. The dense case arises for kernel \"rbf\" which provides symmetric matrices. But if someone provides their own kernel the normalization could be incorrect.\n- In the sparse affinity_matrix case, the current code divides all rows by the sum of the first row. This is not standard normalization, but does not cause errors so long as the row sums are all the same. The sparse case arises for kernel \"knn\" which has all rows sum to k. But if someone provides their own kernel the normalization could be incorrect.\n- The normalization is different for the dense and sparse cases, which could be confusing to someone writing their own kernel.\n\nThe fix involves changing `axis=0` to `axis=1` and correcting the sparse case to divide each row by its sum when the row sums are not all equal.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary> original somewhat rambling description </summary>\n\n** Summary **\nThe method returns a different `affinity_matrix` for sparse and for dense versions of the same kernel matrix. Neither sparse nor dense versions normalize the usual way (columns sum to 1). The dense case is correct for symmetric input kernels. The sparse case scales all values by a constant instead of by column sums.\n\nI suspect the results still converge in most non-symmetric cases. That's probably why this hasn't caused any issue...",

However, as it is just a proof of concept, is not ready to be merged in scikit-learn. \n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nThere are other fast coreset-based algorithms, which are much more complicated to implement, and are practically slower than our algorithm. \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nRecently, I was working on a machine learning project with a dataset that was quite skewed. I repeatedly had to compute the interquartile range (IQR), calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles, visualize the box plot, and then remove outliers — all manually.\n\nWhile this wasn't an issue at first, it became tedious to write the same code over and over again for different rows and columns. This made me wonder: Wouldn’t it be much more efficient if scikit-learn offered a built-in utility to calculate the IQR and optionally remove or flag outliers?\n\nI believe this kind of functionality could significantly streamline the preprocessing workflow for many users.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI’d like to suggest adding a simple utility class to scikit-learn (or as part of a preprocessing module), called OutlierRemoval. This class would encapsulate all IQR-related preprocessing logic and expose a clean interface for users to apply it.\n\n```py\nclass OutlierRemoval:\n    def __init__(self, multiplier: float = 1.5):\n        # Multiplier for the IQR rule (default is 1.5)\n        ...\n\n    def get_q1(self, X, column):\n        # Returns the 25th percentile for a column\n        ...\n\n    def get_q3(self, X, column):\n        # Returns the 75th percentile for a column\n        ...\n\n    def calculate_iqr(self, X, column):\n        # Returns IQR = Q3 - Q1\n        ...\n\n    def plot_boxplot(self, X, column):\n        # Displays a boxplot for the column\n        ...\n\n    def remove_outliers(self, X, column):\n        # Removes rows with outliers from the dataset\n        ...\n```\n\nPrevents redundant code when handling outliers across multiple projects\n\nEncourages best practices in preprocessing pipelines\n\nMakes exploratory data analysis (EDA) cleaner and more intuitive\n\nAligns with scikit-learn’s emphasis on reusable, composable preprocessing tools\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nI've used pandas and numpy to manually calcu...",

This can exhaust file descriptors.\n\nThis one is less severe:\n### In _kddcup99.py:\nLines 390 - 394: The file is opened and manually closed using `file_.close()`, but not inside a `try`/`finally` or `with` block.\nfile_.close() appears after a loop without exceptions. This means that if an error occurs in the loop, the file remains open.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\nCode snippet shouldn't be necessary - \n### Primary Issue in _lfw.py\nOpening many images without closing can exhaust system file descriptors\nUnclosed file handles can prevent garbage collection\nApplications or notebooks that repeatedly fetch the dataset could accumulate thousands of unclosed files\n### Secondary Issue in _kddcup99.py\nIf line.decode() fails (encoding issues), file remains open.\nIf Xy.append() fails (memory constraints), file remains open.\nKeyboard interruption during process, file remains open.\n\n### Expected Results\n\nAll files should be opened using context managers, or \n```python\nwith Image.open(file_path) as pil_img:\n    # processing\n```\nensuring proper closure even if exceptions are raised. This ensures file handles are released immediately, and code is safe under interruption or failure.\n\n### Actual Results\n\nFiles are opened without being explicitly closed, leading to:\nExhaustion of file descriptors when loading the dataset multiple times, unexpected behavior under memory pressure or long sessions.\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    python: 3.13.2 (tags/v3.13.2:4f8bb39, Feb  4 2025, 15:23:48) [MSC v.1942 64 bit (AMD64)]\nexecutable: C:python.exe\n ...",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nBug Report: StackingRegressor in scikit-learn Fails with Custom Neural Network Regressors\nDear scikit-learn Maintainers,\nI am Dr. Mohsen Jahan, Professor of Agroecology and Instructor of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transformation at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. While conducting a research project on multi-objective feature selection using the NSGA-III algorithm and stacking models, I encountered an issue with the StackingRegressor implementation in scikit-learn (version 1.5.2). Specifically, this module exhibits compatibility issues with custom regression models, particularly those based on neural networks such as TabTransformerRegressor, ANNRegressor, and DNNRegressor.\nIssue Description\nWhen using StackingRegressor in scikit-learn with custom regression models that adhere to the standard scikit-learn API (e.g., implementing fit and predict methods) but rely on complex internal structures (e.g., based on tensorflow or pytorch), serialization or cloning errors occur. These errors manifest particularly when such models are used as regressors or meta_regressor in StackingRegressor, affecting processes like GridSearchCV or model persistence with joblib. For instance, in our project, employing a custom SimpleDNNRegressor (built with tensorflow) as the meta-regressor in StackingRegressor resulted in serialization errors. This issue was not observed when using mlxtend.regressor.StackingRegressor (version 0.23.1), which handles custom models more robustly due to its more flexible cloning/serialization mechanisms.\nTechnical Details\n\nscikit-learn Version: 1.5.2\nAffected Models: TabTransformerRegressor, ANNRegressor, DNNRegressor, and likely other neural network-based regressors\nAffected Module: sklearn.ensemble.StackingRegressor\nObserved Errors:\nSerialization errors during GridSearchCV or model saving with joblib.\nIncompatibility with custom models leveraging external libraries (e.g., tensorflow).\n\n\nWorkaround: Using mlxtend.regressor.St...",

This setup has already been successfully integrated into projects like:\n\n✅ [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/13086)\n\n📌 [Tracking issue in NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/29125)\n\nWe’d now like to propose enabling the GitHub Actions app in this repository to allow running CI jobs for ppc64le directly via GitHub Actions. This would support upstream compatibility and help ensure continued support for the Power architecture in scikit-learn.\n\nKey Benefits:\n🔒 Ephemeral and secure runners, isolated per job\n\n🛠️ Maintained by IBM, requires no setup effort from your side\n\n🔁 Integrates with existing GitHub Actions workflows\n\n📚 Technical documentation and usage details:\nhttps://github.com/IBM/actionspz/tree/main/docs\n\nWe’re happy to assist with the setup or provide any additional details the team may need.\n\nThanks so much!",

      "body": "### Describe the issue linked to the documentation\n\nWhen using a Pipeline with PolynomialFeatures and Ridge, it's unclear in the documentation how to extract the actual model coefficients and intercept to reproduce the regression equation manually (outside scikit-learn).\n\nFor example, when fitting a polynomial regression with:\n\nmake_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree=3), Ridge())\n\nMost users wrongly assume that coef_[0] is the intercept, which it is not. This behavior is not explained clearly in the Ridge or Pipeline documentation and led to confusion even after reading the docs and searching online.\n\nThis is a common use case — for example, when exporting trained models to plain Python, Java, or C++.\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\n### ✅ Suggested Fix\n\n\nThe coefficients returned by `.coef_` include the weight for the constant basis function (created by `PolynomialFeatures`), but the actual y-intercept is stored separately in `.intercept_`. This makes it unclear how to reconstruct an equation like:\n\ny = a·x³ + b·x² + c·x + d\n\n### Suggested Fix:\n\n1. In the `Ridge`, `Pipeline`, and/or `PolynomialFeatures` documentation, add a clear explanation that:\n   - `PolynomialFeatures(degree=n)` creates features `[1, x, x², ..., xⁿ]`\n   - The intercept is **not** included in `.coef_`, but is returned separately as `.intercept_`\n   - The first element of `.coef_` corresponds to the coefficient of the constant term `1`, not the model intercept\n\n2. Provided a code snippet that reconstructs the polynomial using both:\n\n```python\ncoefs = model.named_steps['ridge'].coef_\nintercept = model.named_steps['ridge'].intercept_\n```\n\nThis change would help students and developers trying to reproduce the regression manually in another language or platform.",

That was not straightforward.\n\nI eventually found the coefficients under `steps` after someone pointed that out.  Even the answers I got on Google indicated they were under the attribute `coef` but I couldn't find them though I thought I had read the docs sufficiently.\n\nAs explained at the link above, I expected coefficients for an equation: `a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3`.  If I looked at the coefficients under the attribute `coef_` I got: `[ 0.00000000e+00  9.17291774e-01 -4.25186367e-09  9.06355625e-18]`, from which I assumed that meant that `a=0`,` b=9.17291774e-01`, etc.  It turned out that was only partially true, `b-d` are correct but `a` is not.  `a` is actually the interecept which is another attribute `intercept_`.  At least, that is how I got things to work (code below for an example)\n\nQuestion:  what is the first element in the coefficients from Polynomial Ridge Regression or have I completely misunderstood?\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\n\n# regression libs\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n\n# useful initializations\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\np = [0, 10, -20, .30]\n\n# Create fake data using the preceding coefficients with some noise\ndef regr_noise(x, p):\n    mu = np.random.uniform(0,50E6)\n    return (p[0] + p[1]*x + p[2]*x**2 + p[3]*x**3 + mu)...",

This report describes both.\n\n---\n\n### Bug 1: Incorrect Ordering of `drop_intermediate` Relative to Initial Point Prepending\n\nWhen `drop_intermediate=True` (the default), `roc_curve` attempts to simplify the ROC curve by removing intermediate points—those that are collinear with their neighbors and therefore do not affect the curve's shape.\n\nHowever, intermediate points are dropped **before** the initial point `(0, 0)` and the threshold `inf` are prepended to the results.  This causes incorrect retention of points that would otherwise be considered intermediate if the full curve were evaluated from the start.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```python\ny_true  = numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])\ny_score = numpy.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n```\n\nIn this case, a threshold of 4 perfectly separates class 0 from class 1.  The expected simplified ROC curve should be:\n\n```python\nfpr = [0., 0., 1.]\ntpr = [0., 1., 1.]\nthresholds = [inf, 4., 0.]\n```\n\nInstead, the actual output is:\n\n```python\nfpr = [0., 0., 0., 1.]\ntpr = [0., 0.25, 1., 1.]\nthresholds = [inf, 7., 4., 0.]\n```\n\nThe point `(0., 0.25)` is redundant but retained, because it is evaluated before `(0., 0.)` is prepended—leading to an incorrect assessment of its relevance.\n\n#### Root Cause:\n\n```python\n# Incorrect order: intermediates dropped before prepending\nfps, tps, thresholds = _binary_clf_curve(...)\n\nif drop_intermediate:\n    # identify and drop intermediates\n    ...\n\n# only afterward:\nfps = numpy.r_[0, fps]\ntps = numpy.r_[0, tps]\nthresholds = numpy.r_[inf, thresholds]\n```\n\n#### Recommended Fix:\n\nReorder the operations so that the initial point is prepended before identifying intermediate points:\n\n```python\nfps, tps, thresholds = _binary_clf_curve(...)\n\n# Prepend start of curve\nfps = numpy.r_[0, fps]\ntps = numpy.r_[0, tps]\nthresholds = numpy.r_[numpy.inf, thres...",

At the first rounds it tends to select candidates with hyperparameters adapted to small sample sizes that are bad in hindsight, when it's too late.

So, for example, you start with cv=5 and 100 candidates, fit them on folds 2-5, compute scores on fold 1, discard half the candidates, proceed to the next split with test fold = 2 and 50 remaining candidates, etc. It obviously requires more resources than the current implementation, but early selected candidates would be better adapted to the last rounds.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nImplementing the above on top of GridSearchCV.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

From what I can tell, the number of classes is well below 50% of the number of training samples passed to fit().\n\nIt’s possible I’m misunderstanding the intended behavior, but based on reading the source code, it looks like this might be caused by a call to type_of_target(classes_) (instead of y), which could falsely trigger the condition if classes_ is treated like data.\n\n(The same happens with GridSearchCV, for example).\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n\ndef main():\n\t# Simulate 1000 samples, 40 features, 30 classes (<< 50%)\n\tn_samples = 1000\n\tn_features = 40\n\tn_classes = 30\n\n\trng = np.random.RandomState(42)\n\tx = rng.rand(n_samples, n_features)\n\ty = np.tile(np.arange(n_classes), int(np.ceil(n_samples / n_classes)))[:n_samples]\n\n\tprint(f\"Samples: {len(y)}\")\n\tprint(f\"Unique classes: {len(np.unique(y))}\")\n\tprint(f\"Class/sample ratio: {len(np.unique(y)) / len(y):.2%}\")\n\n\tbase_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n\tcal_clf = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_clf, method='isotonic', cv=2)\n\tcal_clf.fit(x, y)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\tmain()\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nI expected no warning to be raised, as the class/sample ratio is only ~3% (well under the 50% threshold).

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHello. Recently, after upgrading to scikit-learn v1.7.0, I encountered an issue when using `DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator` with the `colors` keyword argument. Specifically, the following error is raised:\n```python\n  File \"D:\\Project\\Python Project\\venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\inspection\\_plot\\decision_boundary.py\", line 276, in plot\n    plot_func(self.xx0, self.xx1, response, cmap=cmap, **safe_kwargs)\n    ~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"D:\\Project\\Python Project\\venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\contour.py\", line 689, in __init__\n    raise ValueError('Either colors or cmap must be None')\nValueError: Either colors or cmap must be None\n```\nHowever, in v1.6.0, everything works fine.\n\nAfter further investigation, it seems this issue was introduced by PR #29797, where both `cmap` and `colors` are passed to `plot_func` unconditionally, without explicit conflict handling:\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/d4d4af8c471c60d183d0cb67e14e6434b0ebb9fb/sklearn/inspection/_plot/decision_boundary.py#L276\nAdditionally, when setting `plot_method='contour'` in multiclass classification scenarios, the decision boundary is no longer shown as it was in v1.6.0. It appears that this regression is due to the switch in v1.7.0 to always using a cmap to plot the entire decision surface in multiclass scenarios.\n\nHere are the visual differences:\n- v1.6.0 with `plot_method='contour'`:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/858d2540-47d5-4637-b992-89dc9b196b08)\n- v1.7.0 with the same code:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d7a5c0e-2df9-47c0-bc9c-3a4e0e5dbac4)\n## Suggestion\nTo preserve backward compatibility and expected behavior:\n- Check for mutual exclusivity of `colors` and `cmap` and raise a clear warning/error;\n- Retain the old behavior when `plot_method='contour'`.\n\nI'd be happy to open a PR to help address this regression if the core team is supportive.\n\n### Steps/Code t...",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThis may be more of a discussion, but overall I am not sure what treatment of weighting would preserve the convergence guarantees for the SAG(A) solver. So far as I see it, at each update step we uniformly select some index $i_j$ such that the update steps can be generalised as:\n\n$x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\alpha_{j} S(j, i_{1:k}) f'_{i_j}(x^j)$\n\nWhere $S(j, i_{1:k}) = 1/n$ if $j$ is the maximum iteration at which $i_j$ is selected. \n\nFor frequency based weighting, one could sample $i_j$ using weights as a probability, and under non-uniform sampling the SAG(A) convergence guarantees still seem to hold, (see [here]([https://inria.hal.science/hal-00860051/document])).\n\n Alternatively as currently done, the weights could be multiplied through with the gradient update and that could also work, however I am not sure which method is best (we also here need to additionally consider the division by the cardinality of the set of \"seen\" elements within each update step).\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import kstest\nfrom sklearn.linear_model.tests.test_sag import sag, squared_dloss\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nfrom sklearn.utils._testing import assert_allclose_dense_sparse\n\nstep_size=0.01\nalpha=1\n\nn_features = 1\n\nrng = np.random.RandomState(0)\nX, y = make_regression(n_samples=10000,random_state=77,n_features=n_features)\nweights = rng.randint(0,5,size=X.shape[0])\n\nX_repeated = np.repeat(X,weights,axis=0)\ny_repeated = np.repeat(y,weights,axis=0)\n\nweights_w_all = np.zeros([n_features,100])\nweights_r_all = np.zeros([n_features,100])\n\nfor random_state in np.arange(100):\n\n    weights_w, int_w = sag(X,y,step_size=step_size,alpha=alpha,sample_weight=weights,dloss=squared_dloss,random_state=random_state)\n    weights_w_all[:,random_state] = weights_w\n    weights_r, int_r = sag(X_repeated,y_repeated,step_size=step_size,alpha=alpha,dloss=squared_dloss,random_state=random_state)\n    weights_r_all[:,ra...",

However, in most cases, users can do nothing about the warning.\n\nFurthermore, as seen in the CI of #30878, the array API compatible libraries we test against do not have the same numerical stability behavior for `sum` and `cumsum`, so it makes it challenging to write a test for the occurrence of this warning that is consistent across libraries.\n\nSo I would rather not waste the overhead of computing `np.sum(x)` and just always directly call `np.cumsum` or `xp.cumsum` and deprecate `sklearn.utils.extmath.stable_cumsum`.",

      "title": "Feat: DummyClassifier strategy that produces randomized probabilities",
      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe `dummy` module is fantastic for testing pipelines all the way up through enterprise scales. The [strategies](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/98ed9dc73/sklearn/dummy.py#L374) offered in the `DummyClassifier` are excellent for testing corner cases. However, the strategies offered fall short when testing pipelines that include downstream tasks that depend on moments of the predicted probabilities (e.g. gains charts).\n\nThis is because the existing strategies do not include sampling _random probabilities_.\n\n## Proposed API:\n\nConsider adding a new strategy with a name like `uniform-proba` or `score-random` or something similar that results in this behavior for binary classification:\n\n```python\nprint(DummyClassifier(strategy=\"uniform-proba\").fit(X, y).predict_proba(X))\n\"\"\"\n[[0.5651713  0.4348287 ]\n [0.36557341 0.63442659]\n [0.42386353 0.57613647]\n ...\n [0.30348692 0.69651308]\n [0.59589879 0.40410121]\n [0.32664176 0.67335824]]\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\n## Proposed implementation\n\nI had something like this in mind:\n```python\nclass DummyClassifier(MultiOutputMixin, ClassifierMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    ...\n\n    def predict_proba(self, X):\n        ...\n        for k in range(self.n_outputs_):\n            if self._strategy == \"uniform-proba\":\n                out = rs.dirichlet([1] * n_classes_[k], size=n_samples)\n                out = out.astype(np.float64)\n            ...\n```\n\nSimilar to the `\"stratified\"` strategy, this simple implementation relies on `numpy.random`, in this case the [`dirichlet`](https://numpy.org/doc/2.0/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.RandomState.dirichlet.html) distribution. By setting all the `alpha`s to 1, we are specifying that the probabilities of each class are equally distributed -- in contrast, the `\"stratified\"` strategy effectively samples from a dirichlet distribution with one alpha equal to 1 and the rest equal to 0.\n\n\n### Describe altern...",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI also just ran into this issue that the program gets killed when running DBSCAN, similar to:\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22531\n\nThe documentation update already helps and I think it's ok for the algorithm to fail. But currently there is no way for me to recover, and a more informative error message would be useful. Since now DBSCAN just reports `killed` and it requires a bit of search to see what fails:\n```\n>>> DBSCAN(eps=1, min_samples=2).fit(np.random.rand(10_000_000, 3))\nKilled\n```\n\ne.g., something like how `numpy` does it:\n```\n>>> n = int(1e6)\n>>> np.random.rand(n, n)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"numpy/random/mtrand.pyx\", line 1219, in numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.rand\n  File \"numpy/random/mtrand.pyx\", line 437, in numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.random_sample\n  File \"_common.pyx\", line 307, in numpy.random._common.double_fill\nnumpy.core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError: Unable to allocate 7.28 TiB for an array with shape (1000000, 1000000) and data type float64\n```\n\nAdditionally, I noted that the memory accumulated with consecutive calling of DBSCAN. Which can lead to a killed program even though there is enough memory when running a single fit.\nI was able to resolve this by explicitly calling `import gc; gc.collect()` after each run. Maybe this could be invoked at the end of each DBSCAN fit?\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\ntry:\n    DBSCAN(eps=1, min_samples=2).fit(np.random.rand(10_000_000, 3))\nexcept:\n    print(\"Caught exception\")\n```\n\n\n### Expected Results\n\n```python\nCaught exception\n```\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```python\nKilled\n```\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\n>>> import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()\n\nSystem:\n    python: 3.10.12 (main, Feb  4 2025, 14:57:36) [GCC 11.4.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\n   machine: Linux-6.14.6-arch1-1-x86_64-with-glibc2.35\n\nPython dependencies:\n      sklearn: 1.6.1\n          pip: None\n   setuptools: 80.7.1\n        numpy: 1.26.4...",

This leads to inefficiencies fitting kernel (hyper) parameters.\nThe root of the issue is in that the gradient of the kernel function is made with respect to the log of the kernel parameter.\n\nSee the plot on the right showcasing the incorrect gradient currently being used in the optimization step:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec7f5582-b928-4738-9371-02ad1391c7c4)\n\n\nTo fix this apply the chain rule giving:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial k(x)}{\\partial \\ln(x)} \\frac{\\partial \\ln(x)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial k(x)}{\\partial x}$\n$\\frac{\\partial k(x)}{\\partial \\ln(x)} \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\partial k(x)}{\\partial x}$\n\nWhen implementing this the correct gradient is given (middle plot).\n\n\nTO REPRODUCE THIS BUG - see [my branch](https://github.com/conradstevens/scikit-learn/tree/gpr-log-likelihood-check) \nspecifically: [sklearn/gaussian_process/tests/test_gpr_loglikelihood_check.py](https://github.com/conradstevens/scikit-learn/blob/gpr-log-likelihood-check/sklearn/gaussian_process/tests/test_gpr_loglikelihood_check.py)\n\nI am happy to fix this bug by modifying the `_gpr` class's `log_marginal_likelihood` function.

Homebrew's own output (`brew info libomp`) often provides guidance on the necessary `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.\n\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nThe documentation could be updated to:\n1.  Mention the different Homebrew base paths for Intel (`/usr/local`) and Apple Silicon (`/opt/homebrew`).\n2.

MKL is a more advanced approach compared to GridSearchCV, offering a way to combine multiple kernels into a single, optimal kernel. In the worst case, MKL will behave like GridSearchCV by assigning a weight of 1 to the best kernel, but in the other cases, it will provide a weighted combination of kernels for better generalization.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI have already implemented a complete MKL solution for regression, binary and multi-class classification, and clustering (One-Class). This implementation includes the [SimpleMKL algorithm](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/rakotomamonjy08a/rakotomamonjy08a.pdf), which optimizes the weights of the kernels, as well as the AverageMKL (simply averages the kernels) and SumMKL (simply sums the kernels) algorithms. This implementation is available on a [previously closed pull request](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31166).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nAn alternative would be to continue relying on GridSearchCV for kernel selection. However, GridSearchCV is limited to selecting only one kernel and does not consider the possibility of combining multiple kernels, which can result in suboptimal performance. MKL provides a more sophisticated approach by optimizing kernel weights, leading to better performance in many machine learning tasks.",

This would present a more elegant solution than using the method train_test_split twice.\n\n```python \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_val_test_split\nX_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = train_validation_test_split(\n    X, y,\n    train_size=0.6,\n    val_size=0.2,\n    test_size=0.2,\n    random_state=42,\n    shuffle=True,\n    stratify=y\n)\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nAdd a new method called train_test_validation_split where the dataset is divided into train, validation and test set. The arguments would be the same as the train_test_split method with the additional  val_size, similar to test_size and train_size but for the validation set.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nUsing train_test_split twice works, but having a dedicated train_validation_test_split function would be cleaner and more concise.\n\n### Additional context\n\nUsing a validation set helps avoiding both overfitting aswell as underfitting.",

I frequently use [sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances.html) to estimate distances on the globe. The example on the linked page uses a geographic example, but it does not specify whether geographic coordinates are in (latitude, longitude) or (longitude, latitude) form. From context, one can infer that the correct order is (latitude,longitude); however, it would be useful to explicitly state the order.\n\nThis is my first issue submission; please let me know if there is something more that might be useful for resolution!\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nThere are two ways that this could be resolved:\n1. Include a short note stating that geographic coordinates should be input as (latitude,longitude)\n2. Include a comment in the example code describing the coordinate order.",

This is mostly a summary of discussions so far. If we are happy with a decision, we can move to updating the documentation.\n\n---\n\nFor classification metrics to support array API, there is a problem in the case where `y_pred` is not in the same namespace/device as `y_true`.\n\n`y_pred` is likely to be the output of `predict_proba` or `decision_function` and would be in the same namespace/device as `X` (if we decide in #28668 that \"everything should follow X\").\n`y_true` could be an integer array or a numpy array or pandas series (this is pertinent as `y_true` may be string labels)\n\nMotivating use case:\n\nUsing e.g., `GridSearchCV` or `cross_validate` with a pipeline that moves `X` to GPU.\nConsider a pipeline like below (copied from https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28668#issuecomment-2154958666): \n\n```python\npipeline = make_pipeline(\n   SomeDataFrameAwareFeatureExtractor(),\n   MoveFeaturesToPyTorch(device=\"cuda\"),\n   SomeArrayAPICapableClassifier(),\n)\n```\n\nPipelines do not ever touch `y` so we are not able to alter `y` within the pipeline.\nWe would need to pass a metric to `GridSearchCV` or `cross_validate`, which would be passed `y_true` and `y_pred` on different namespace / devices.\n\nThus the motivation to automatically move `y_true` to the same namespace / device as `y_pred`, in metrics functions.\n\n(Note another example is discussed in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30439#issuecomment-2531072292)\n\nAs it is more likely that `y_pred` is on GPU, `y_true` follow `y_pred` was slightly preferred over `y_pred` follows `y_true`. Computation wise, CPU vs GPU is probably similar for metrics like log-loss, but for metrics that require sorting (e.g., ROC AUC) GPU may be faster?

      "body": "(disclaimer: this issue and associated PR are part of a student project supervised by @smarie )\n\n### Summary\n\nEigendecomposition is slow when number of samples is large. This impacts decomposition models such as KernelPCA and Isomap. A \"randomized\" eigendecomposition method (from [Halko et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4061)) [has been introduced for KernelPCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#choice-of-solver-for-kernel-pca) leveraging Halko's algorithm 4.3 for randomized SVD decomposition (also used in [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca-using-randomized-svd)).\n\nUnfortunately, the current approach is only valid for decomposition of PSD matrices - which suits well for KernelPCA but can not be true in the context of Isomap. Therefore Isomap has not accelerated implementation as of today.\n\nWe propose to introduce an additional approximate eigendecomposition method based on algorithm 5.3 from the same paper.\nThis method should offer a faster alternative to existing solvers (arpack, dense, etc.) while maintaining accuracy, and as opposed to randomized svd, is suitable to find eigenvalues for non-PSD matrices.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\n- Implement `_randomized_eigsh(selection='value')`, that is left as [NotImplemented](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12069) today.\n- Integrate it as an alternate solver in `Isomap` and in `KernelPCA`.\n- Add tests comparing performance with existing solvers.\n- Provide benchmarks to evaluate speedup and accuracy.\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n- Improves scalability for large datasets.\n- Reduces computation time for eigen decomposition-based methods.\n\nNote: this solution could be used to accelerate all models relying on eigenvalue decomposition, including possibly https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22330",

As a result transitioning from R to Python often leads to discrepancies in model behavior and performance.\n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI propose extending `PolynomialFeatures` with a new parameter:\n<pre>\nPolynomialFeatures(..., method=\"raw\")\n</pre>\nAccepted values:\n- `\"raw\"` (default): retains existing behavior, returning standard raw terms\n- `\"qr\"`: applies QR decomposition to each feature to generate orthogonal polynomial features.\n\nBecause R's `poly()` only operates on 1D input vectors, my thought was to apply QR decomposition feature by feature when the input is multi-dimensional. Each column is processed independently, mirroring R's approach.\n\nThis feature would interact with other parameters as follows:\n\n- `include_bias`: When `method=\"qr\"`, The orthogonal polynomial basis inherently includes a transformed first column. However, this column is not a plain column of ones. Therefore, the concept of `include_bias=True` (which appends a column of ones) becomes redundant or misleading in this context. One option is to always set  `include_bias=False` if `method=qr` and always return orthogonal columns only, or raise a warning.\n\n-...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nHi, while working on a classification problem I found out there is no dedicated function to compute the P4 metric implemented in sklearn. As a reminder, P4 metrics is a binary classification metric that is commonly seen as an extension of the f_beta metrics because it takes into account all four True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative values, and because is it symmetrical unlike the f_beta metrics.\n\nP4 is defined as follows : P4 = 4 / ( 1/precision + 1/recall + 1/specificity + 1/NPV )\n\nWikipedia page right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P4-metric)\n\nMedium article right [there](https://medium.com/@thomas.vidori/better-than-the-f1-score-discover-the-p-4-score-903242e9545b)\n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nMy idea was to create a function `p4_support` similar to `precision_recall_fscore_support`. Since it is a binary metric, multiclass and multi-label inputs would be managed with `multilabel_confusion_matrix` so the arguments for `average` would be `'macro', 'samples', 'weighted', 'binary', None`.\nI would compute all necessaries values such as 1/precision, 1/recall, 1/specificity and 1/NPV using `_prf_divide`. If any of these four ratios are zero divisions, then P4 would also return the zero division argument. Indeed, for example if precision is null, then 1/precision is +inf and the whole denominator of the P4 is +inf which make P4 = 0 (Btw, this behavior is a reason why it is harder to achieve a high P4 score than f_score since all four ratios need to be 1 to have a P4 equals to 1.). The function would return the tuple (p4_value, support)\n\nA second function `p4_score` which would be the one actually used by users would return only the first element of the previously described `p4_support` function.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nExtras : \n\nSince specificity and NVP are computed anyway, the `p4_support` function could return the tuple (specificity, NVP, p4_sco...",

      "body": "This issue is about addressing a `ConvergenceWarning` that occurs when running the `examples/gaussian_process/plot_gpr_on_structured_data.py `example in CI (also when building the documentation locally).\n\nThe example creates three plots. The last use case on a classification of DNA sequences throws a `ConvergenceWarning` related to the `baseline_similarity_bounds` defined in a custom kernel when fitting. It seems that the lower bound is pushed resulting in the lack of convergence.\n\nThis occurs with the setting `baseline_similarity_bounds=(1e-5, 1))` in the custom kernel.\n\nEven setting `baseline_similarity_bounds=(1e-40, 1)) ` results in the same warning:\n```\nConvergenceWarning: The optimal value found for dimension 0 of parameter baseline_similarity is close to the specified lower bound 1e-40. Decreasing the bound and calling fit again may find a better value.\n```\n\nLowering the bound further with `baseline_similarity_bounds=(1e-50, 1)) ` results in a different warning stemming from `lbfgs`:\n```\nConvergenceWarning: lbfgs failed to converge (status=2): ABNORMAL: .\nIncrease the number of iterations (max_iter) or scale the data as shown in: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html\n```\n\nIt would be preferable to resolve this so the example can be build without displaying warnings.\n\n\nWhile being at the example, other small improvements are welcome (for instance fixing the typo in \"use of kernel functions that operates\" (the s in operates)).",

This kind of model exists in R, but not in scikit-learn. Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process Regressor is a simple enhancement over standard GP that allows to use GP on large datasets. It also recently gained interest among the GPytorch package, see e.g. [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01694).\n\n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI already have a scikit-learn-like implementation that I could bring to this project. This implementation becomes more convenient (uses less memory and less runtime) than classic Gaussian Process Regressor from a dataset size of approx 10k. It is based on Datta's work, so it's not as the one in the GPytorch package. If anyone deems this model interesting enough, I'm wiling to make a PR.\n\nHaving a baseline CPU-base implementation in scikit-learn could also server as a starting point for future GPU-based implementations, which is were this model really shines (e.g. inheriting from scikit-learn class and implementing in GPU the most time consuming operations). As an example, I also have a cupy-based implementation of Datta's NNGP which competes very well against GPytorch VNNGP.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nAs mentioned above, a version of NNGP is implemented in GPytorch. GPytorch implementation however is not only based on Nearest Neighbors, but also on Variational method. The one from Datta's is simpler being only based on NN and can become competitive with more complex methods VNNGP when using GPUs.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nFirst of all, thank you guys for the fantastic job with Sklearn. \nI'm trying to build from source to start contributing to the project, but it ended with me bringing more issues to you. \nAfter struggling for some days with this problem, I'm seeking help. Maybe if you have some clue or workaround, I could open a Pull Request with the solution for this.\n\nI am following the guidelines for [Contributing with Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#contributing), and for that, it is necessary to [Build from source on Windows](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#windows), which recomends install  Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019, but nowadays is not possible to download the 2019 version just the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 installer](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_buildtools.exe).\n\nThe installation of Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 runs smoothly(and also the initialization of its Environment), as well as the creation of the Python virtual environment and the installation of the packages `wheel, numpy, scipy, cython, meson-python, ninja`.\n\nBut in the step of building from source using the `pip install --editable`, the build breaks when Compiling C objects after some [C4090 warnings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4090?view=msvc-170), throwing an `metadata-generation-failed error` from a subprocess of `ninja build`.\n\nThis seems related/similar to issue #31123. Despite not being the same problem, if we find a solution, it may work for both issues.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\nI have tried the steps using `pip install` and also `conda-forge` in different versions of Python: pip :{3.10.11, 3.12.7} conda:{ 3.13.2}  to check if it was a problem with Python/pip itself.\n\n1. **Environment Setup:**\n- OS:  Windows 11 Pro, Version 24H2, OS build 26100.3476\n- System type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor...",

The build proceeds through the Meson setup phase correctly identifying the `clang` compiler, but fails during the `ninja` compilation phase with an error indicating it cannot create a specific, deeply nested intermediate build directory.\n\nThis occurs despite successfully building other complex dependencies like NumPy (v2.2.4) and SciPy (v1.15.2) from source in the *exact same environment*. Pandas (v2.2.3) also builds successfully after setting `MESON_DISABLE_VSENV=1` (otherwise it incorrectly selects MSVC). This suggests the issue might be specific to how scikit-learn's build structure interacts with Meson/Ninja within this particular toolchain environment.\n\nThis is related to, but distinct from, #30567 which requests pre-built wheels. This issue focuses on a specific build-from-source failure.\n\n**Steps/Code to Reproduce**\n\n1.  **Environment Setup:**\n    *   OS: Windows 11 Pro ARM64 (via Parallels on Apple Silicon M2, or on native hardware like Windows Dev Kit 2023)\n    *   MSYS2: Latest version, updated via `pacman -Syu`.\n    *   MSYS2 Environment: `CLANGARM64` shell launched.\n    *   Key MSYS2 Packages (installed via `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-<package>`):\n        *   `python` (3.12.x)\n        *   `clang` (20.1.1)\n        *   `flang` (20.1.1)\n        *   `meson` (1.7.0)\n        *   `ninja` (1.12.1)\n        *   `pkgconf`\n        *   `openblas`\n        *   `lapack`\n        *   `openssl`\n        *   `hdf5`\n        *   `rust`\n        *   `zlib`\n    *   Project Location: Tried both native MSYS2 path (`/home/user/project`) and WSL interop path (`//wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/...`) - error persists in both.\n\n2.  **Python Virtual Environment:**\n    ```bash\n    # In CLANGARM64 shell, navigate to project directory\n    python -m venv .venv\n    source .venv/bin/activate #...",

This started last Friday 21st of March 2025.\n\nWhat puzzles me is that we haven't made any modifications to our code, the data hasn't changed (at least in our TEST environment) and we didn't change the version of scikit-learn.\nThe exact command that throws the error is:\n\n```python\nnbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 1, metric = 'cosine').fit(X)\n```\n\nwhere X is a sparse matrix compressed to sparse rows that contains 38506x53709 elements.\n\nWe run the code on Databricks (runtime 15.4LTS, where scikit-learn is on 1.3.0).\nI also tried with scikit-learn 1.4.2 (preinstalled in Databricks runtime 16.2) but had the same issue.\n\nThe error suggests a memory issue, but I'm struggling to understand why this would happen now while the context is exactly the same as what it was before. Furthermore, we use the same code with the same Databricks cluster for another data set which is at least 6x bigger and that one runs successfully in just a few seconds.\n\nI'm not a data scientist and therefore quite confused as to why this would no longer run. Since our environment didn't change, I was wondering if anything would have changed in respect to scikit-learn v1.3.0 for any odd reason, or if you heard anything similar recently from some other user(s)?\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n\ndf_table = df_table.toPandas().add_prefix(\"b.\")\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer = 'char', ngram_range = (1, 4))\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_table['b.concat_match_col'].values.astype('U'))\nnbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 1, metric = 'cosine').fit(X)\n\n# ...",

This is not only on our estimators, but also sometimes on other objects such as display objects.\n\nSince we've had issues / confusions before, I was wondering if we'd want to introduce meaningful error messages when somebody tries to access an attribute which is not there yet, and we can tell them why it's not there. Like, `Call fit to have this attribute` or `set store_cv_results=True to have this attribute.`\n\nIn terms of UX, that to me is a very clear improvement, but I'm not sure if we want to add the complexity.

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nDuring model development, it's common to perform train-test splits multiple times on a dataset. This may occur during development iterations, when the dataset evolves over time, or when working with different data subsets. However, the current `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` function has a subtle failure mode: even with a fixed random seed, it doesn't guarantee consistent splits in these scenarios. A simple modification like adding a single row or reordering the dataset can result in completely different splits, making debugging particularly challenging.\n\nThis limitation is well-recognized in the data science community. This is documented in a blog post [1], and popular book like Aurélien Géron's \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow\" includes custom implementations to address this problem [2-4].\n\nTo resolve this, we propose implementing a stable splitting mechanism based on unique identifiers. This approach would ensure that specific entries consistently remain in the same split, regardless of dataset modifications. \n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'id': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110],\n    'feature': [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9, 10.1],\n    'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n})\n\ntrain, test= train_test_split( df, test_size=0.3, random_state=42  )\nprint(\"initial split:\\n\",\n    test)\n\ndf = pd.concat([df, pd.DataFrame(\n                {'id': [111], \n                'feature': [11.1],\n                'target': [1]}\n                )],\n                ignore_index=True)\ntrain, test = train_test_split( df, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\nprint(\"split after adding a new row:\\n\",\n    test)\n\n# initial split:\n#      id  feature  target\n# 8  109      9.9       0\n# 1  102      2.2       1\n# 5  106      6.6       1\n# split after adding a new row:\n#       id  feature  target\n# 5   106      6.6       1\n# 0...",

I give an example below, and an example use case can be found in soda-inria/tabicl#2.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that `ColumnTransformer` interprets integers as column positions, while here the integers are the columns names. In my example below, `sklearn.compose.make_column_selector(dtype_include=\"number\")(x)` returns `[0, 2]` which is interpreted as positions by `ColumnTransformer` while the admissible positions for `x` are in `[0, 1]`.\n\nA workaround for the user is to always convert names to positions prior to giving them to `ColumnTransformer`, like:\n```python\nnumeric_features = sklearn.compose.make_column_selector(dtype_include=\"number\")(x)\nnumeric_positions = [x.columns.get_loc(col) for col in numeric_features]\n```\n\nHowever I'm wondering if this is something that should be taken care of on the `ColumnTransformer` side. Shouldn't `ColumnTransformer` always interpret given column names as names, even when they are integers?\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn.compose\nimport sklearn.impute\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng(0)\nx = pd.DataFrame(rng.random((10, 3)))\n\nx = x.iloc[:, [0, -1]]  # comment this out to make the test pass\n\ntransformer = sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer(\n    transformers=[\n        (\n            \"continuous\",\n            sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer(),\n            sklearn.compose.make_column_selector(dtype_include=\"number\"),\n        )\n    ]\n)\n\ntransformer.fit(x)\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nNo error is thrown.\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_indexing.py\", line 315, in _get_column_indices_for_bool_or_int\n    idx = _safe_indexing(np.arange(n_columns), key)\n  File \"python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_indexing.py\", line 270, in _safe_inde...",

      "body": "### **Proposed new feature or change:**\nHi Team,\n\nWe would like to upstream support for the Power (PPC64LE) architecture in scikit-learn by adding a new CI job in wheels.yml. This will enable continuous integration (CI) support for PPC64LE using a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner.\n\n**What We've Done So Far**\n\n1. **Forking and Building:**\n  - We forked the scikit-learn repository and successfully built and tested wheels for PPC64LE using an ephemeral self-hosted runner on an OSU Power machine.\n\n2. **Using cibuildwheel:**\n  -  We leveraged **cibuildwheel**, the same tool used for building wheels on other architectures and confirmed that it works smoothly for PPC64LE.\n\n3. **Modifications:**\n  - The key change involves adding a new job for PPC64LE in the **wheels.yml** file.\n  - This ensures that scikit-learn can be built and tested automatically for Power architecture alongside other existing platforms.\n\n**Why We're Proposing These Changes**\n\n- Enabling CI support for PPC64LE ensures continuous testing and validation, improving compatibility and reliability for Power users.\n- The self-hosted runner ensures minimal impact on existing CI/CD pipelines since it only runs when triggered.\n- Other projects, such as PyTorch, have adopted a similar approach for alternative architectures like s390x\n\n**Details of Self-Hosted Runner Setup**\n\n- We have successfully set up an ephemeral self-hosted runner for PPC64LE on an OSU VM, following an approach similar to [s390x.](https://github.com.mcas.ms/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.github/scripts/s390x-ci/README.md)\n- The runner remains in listening mode and can be triggered by specific workflows (e.g., trunk updates), ensuring efficient usage.\n\n**Details of OSU and IBM Power Support**\n\nThrough a partnership between IBM and the Oregon State University (OSU) Open Source Lab (OSL), infrastructure is provided for open-source development:\n\n- **Architecture**: Power Little-Endian (LE)\n- **Virtualization**: Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)\n- *...",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nKBinsDiscretizer uniform strategy uses numpy.linspace to make bin edges. \n\nnumpy.linspace works out a delta like: delta = (max - min)/num_bins \n\nThen the bin edges are computed: delta * n\n\nThe issue is the floating point multiplication introduces noise in the low bits. \n\nFor example, consider the case of floating point sample values from zero to one and five bins. Then:\n\ndelta = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nThe right edge of bin 2 (zero indexed) should be 0.6 = 0.2 * 3 but (in my tests) it's 0.6000000000000001 \n\nExample python calculation:\n\n```python\n>>> 1/5 * 3\n0.6000000000000001\n```\n\nThis means a sample values of 0.6 get assigned to bin 2 but it should be in bin 3\n\nOne work around is to use the fractions module or better still the decimal module. The code below demonstrates the issue\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport decimal\nimport fractions\nimport sys\nfrom typing import NoReturn\n\n\ndef test_float_fractions():\n    # check floating point multiplication\n    step = 1 / 5\n    f_step = fractions.Fraction(1, 5)\n    d_step = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(5)\n\n    print('float vs fractions')\n    for n in range(101):\n        float_value = step * n\n        fraction_value = f_step * n\n        fraction_float = float(fraction_value)\n        if float_value != fraction_float:\n            fraction_str = str(fraction_value)\n            print(f'{n:2} float {float_value:20.16f} fraction {fraction_float:20.16f} {fraction_str:>5}')\n\n    print('')\n    print('float vs decimals')\n    for n in range(101):\n        float_value = step * n\n        decimal_value = d_step * n\n        if float_value != decimal_value:\n            print(f'{n:2} float {float_value:23.20f}  decimal {decimal_value:23.20f}')\n\n\ndef main(argv) -> NoReturn:\n    m = 0\n    try:\n        test_float_fractions()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'Exception: {e}')\n    sys.exit(m)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main(sys.argv[1:])\n```\n\nRunning the above yields the output below:\n\n\n```shell\nfloat vs fractio...",

However, there is no mention if `random_state` and `n_jobs > 1` interact in any unexpected way.\n\nLets consider a typical use case where a user cross validates a `RandomForestClassifier` with `KFold`:\n```python\nestimator = RandomForestClassifer(random_state=np.random.RandomState(1))  # Recommended to pass RandomState instance.\nkfold = KFold(shuffle=True, random_state=42)  # Recommended to pass int.\ncross_val_score(estimator, n_jobs=-1, ..., cv=kfold)\n```\nSince `n_jobs=-1` this means that multiple cores will be used for cross validation (e.g. 1 core per fold).\n\nWould the same state be used for the different folds, since during multiprocessing the estimator and hence the `rng` passed to it, is copied via fork?\n\n</div>",

I'm trying to use metadata routing with `BaggingClassifier` and `BaggingRegressor` however it is implemented for the `fit` method, not the `predict` one. I am wondering if there is a particular reason for not doing it on the predict function or if this is a feature that could be added. This would enable situations like the following, which currently gives an error:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator\n\nsklearn.set_config(enable_metadata_routing=True)\n\n\nclass CustomEstimator(BaseEstimator):\n    def fit(self, X, y, foo):\n        return self\n\n    def predict(self, X, bar):\n        return np.zeros(X.shape[0])\n\n\nestimator = CustomEstimator()\nestimator.set_fit_request(foo=True)\nestimator.set_predict_request(bar=True)\nmodel = ensemble.BaggingRegressor(estimator)\n\nn, p = 10, 2\nrng = np.random.default_rng(0)\nx = rng.random((n, p))\ny = rng.integers(0, 2, n)\n\nmodel.fit(x, y, foo=True)\nmodel.predict(x, bar=True). # TypeError: BaggingRegressor.predict() got an unexpected keyword argument 'bar'\n\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nSimilar to the fit method, something like:\n```python\nif _routing_enabled():\n    routed_params = process_routing(self, \"predict\", **predict_params)\n```\n\nHowever, I don't have enough understanding of the metadata routing implementation to know exactly what should be done.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI tried to have a look at the history of PRs/Issues to find a discussion around this point, but could not find it in the PR introducing the metadata routing to these estimators (#28432).",

I tried to subclass from `Pipeline`\nto implement a customization, so having a simplified configuration, which is used to build a sequence of transformations.  \n\nIt generates an `AttributeError`, due to not having an instance attribute with the same name as a positional argument (same is true for a kwarg) of the subclasses's init. Find a minimal example below.\n\nIs this expected behavior? It does not harm to set the instance attributes with the same name, but it is surprising it is demanded and is very implicit. Also, it does not pop up, when you instantiate the object, but only when you try to call a method on it.\n\nIn case it is absolutely necessary, it may need some documentation. \n\nIn addition, I tried to globally skip parameter validation and it did not help in this situation, which might be a real bug?\n \nThanks for your help, and your good work:)\n\nA simple example: \n```python\nimport sklearn\nsklearn.set_config(\n    skip_parameter_validation=True,  # disable validation\n)\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\nclass TakeColumn(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\n    def __init__(self, column: str):\n        self.column = column\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.__class__.__name__ + f\"[{self.column}]\"\n\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        return self\n\n    def transform(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n        return X[[self.column]]\n\n\nclass CategoricalFeature(Pipeline):\n    def __init__(self, column: str, encode=True):\n\n        take_column = TakeColumn(column)\n        steps = [(str(take_column), take_column)]\n\n        if encode:\n            encoder = OneHotEncoder()\n            steps.append((str(encoder), encoder))\n\n        # setting instance attributes having the same name, removes t...",

Also, when omitting both `y` and `groups`, or only `y` the result is `ValueError: Supported target types are: ('binary', 'multiclass'). Got 'unknown' instead.` This indicates, contrary to the signature, that `y` and `groups are required and not optional.\n\nI would instead expect consisted behavior with e.g. `StratifiedKFold`, where the `y` parameter to `split` is not optional.\n\n`StratifiedKFold` and `StratifiedGroupKFold` both inherit from `_BaseKFold`, which provides `.split`.

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHello, while using metadata routing I encountered what seems to be a bug. I do not have enough understanding of metadata routing to determine if it is actually a bug or an incorrect use.\n\nBelow is an example where I am using a meta estimator (`BaggingRegressor`) around a base estimator (`DecisionTreeRegressor`). In my use case, I need to dynamically wrap the base estimator in an `Adapter` to do some work before calling the fit method of the base estimator. This work is based on an extra parameter `extra_param`, which I request using the `set_fit_request` method. The parameter is passed sucessfully, but its type is altered from string to list on one edge case (when the string matches the number of samples of X).\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn import base, ensemble, tree\n\nsklearn.set_config(enable_metadata_routing=True)\n\n\nclass Adapter(base.BaseEstimator):\n    def __init__(self, wrapped_estimator):\n        self.wrapped_estimator = wrapped_estimator\n\n    def fit(self, X, y, extra_param: str):\n        # Do some work before delegating to the wrapped_estimator's fit method\n        print(extra_param)\n        assert isinstance(extra_param, str)\n        return self.wrapped_estimator.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Delegate other methods\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        return getattr(self.wrapped_estimator, name)\n\n\nn, p = 10, 2\nrng = np.random.default_rng(0)\nx = rng.random((n, p))\ny = rng.integers(0, 2, n)\n\nestimator = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()\nadapter = Adapter(estimator)\nadapter.set_fit_request(extra_param=True)\nmeta_estimator = ensemble.BaggingRegressor(adapter, n_estimators=1)\n\nmeta_estimator.fit(x, y, extra_param=\"a\" * (n - 1))  # Pass\nmeta_estimator.fit(x, y, extra_param=\"a\" * (n + 1))  # Pass\nmeta_estimator.fit(x, y, extra_param=\"a\" * n)  # Fail\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nNo error is thrown.

      "title": "Add Weighted Euclidean Distance Metric",
      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nThe workflow I want to enable is the ability for users to easily incorporate feature importance into distance-based algorithms like clustering (e.g., KMeans) and nearest neighbors (e.g., KNeighborsClassifier). Currently, scikit-learn allows users to define custom distance metrics, but there is no built-in support for weighted distance metrics, which are essential when certain features are more important than others.\n\nExample Workflow:\nA user has a dataset where some features are more relevant than others (e.g., in customer segmentation, age and income might be more important than the number of children).\n\nThe user wants to use a clustering algorithm like KMeans or a nearest neighbors algorithm like KNeighborsClassifier but needs to account for the varying importance of features.\n\nThe user specifies a vector of weights corresponding to the importance of each feature.\n\nThe algorithm uses the weighted Euclidean distance metric to compute distances, ensuring that more important features have a greater influence on the results.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nI propose adding a Weighted Euclidean Distance Metric to scikit-learn as a built-in distance metric. This will allow users to specify feature weights directly, making it easier to incorporate feature importance into distance-based algorithms.\n **Key Components of the Solution:**\n\n1. New Class: \n\n- Add a WeightedEuclideanDistance class to the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module.\nThis class will accept a vector of weights during initialization.\n- It will compute the weighted Euclidean distance between two points using the formula:\n**d(x, y) = sqrt( summation from i = 1 to n of [ w_i * (x_i - y_i) squared ] )**\nwhere ​wi are the user-defined weights.\n\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nWhy This Feature is Needed:\n\n- Feature Importance: In many real-world datasets, not all features are equally important.

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nMost classifiers and regressors expected unbounded input. Bounded input typically comes in the forms (a, infty) and (a, b) with the important special cases (0, infty) for radii, counts, and other things that are always non-negative, and (0, 1) for probabilities and fractions. One needs a way to transform bounded data to the unbounded domain that works with all classifiers and regressors.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nA new transform should be implemented to convert bounded domains into the unbounded domain, tentatively called `UnboundTransform`. The transform can optionally be chained by a PowerTransform to make the output more gaussian. The `UnboundTransform` will apply scale and shift options and the log transform or the logit transform to convert half-bounded and fully bounded data, respectively.\n\nBecause bounds are difficult to estimate from a distribution, the user should pass the bounds on construction.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n* The Yeo-Johnson power transform does not make a bounded variable unbounded.\n* The QuantileTransform overfits on small samples and its tail behavior is unpredictable. It is also computationally expensive.\n* The FunctionTransform is a generic solution and able to perform this task, but the user has to provide the transforms. Since making data unbounded is such a common thing, having a specialized transform for this case is justified, to avoid letting users reinvert the wheel many times.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI am interested in implementing the transforms and submitting a PR. I previously contributed to numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, and am the maintainer of several OSS libraries for data analysis here on Github used in (astro)particle physics.",

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThis issue comes from my (possibly incorrect) understanding that `LinearRegression` and `Ridge` classes should handle the dimensions of the `X` and `y` parameters to the `fit` method in the same way in a sense that the *same* pair of `(X, y)` parameter values provided to *both* `LinearRegression.fit()` and `Ridge.fit()` methods should produce the `coef_` attribute values of the *same shape* in both classes.\n\nBut it appears that in case of a 2D shaped parameter `y` of the form `(n_samples, n_targets)` with `n_targets = 1` passed into the `fit` method, the resulting shapes of `coef_` attribute differ between `LinearRegression` and `Ridge` classes.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn\n\nX = np.array([10, 15, 21]).reshape(-1, 1)\ny = np.array([50, 70, 63]).reshape(-1, 1)\n\nassert X.shape == (3, 1), f\"Shape of X must be (n_samples = 3, n_features = 1)\"\nassert y.shape == (3, 1), f\"Shape of y must be (n_samples = 3, n_targets = 1)\"\n\nlinX = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()\nlinX.fit(X, y)\n\nridgeX = sklearn.linear_model.Ridge(alpha=10**9.5)\nridgeX.fit(X, y)\n\nassert linX.coef_.shape == ridgeX.coef_.shape, f\"Shapes of coef_ attributes do not agree. LinearRegression has {linX.coef_.shape}. Ridge has {ridgeX.coef_.shape}\"\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nThe example code should produce no output and throw no error.\n\nAccording to the [`LinearRegression` docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#), the resulting value of the `coef_` attribute should be 2D shaped as `(n_targets = 1, n_features = 1)`. This is what happens in my minimal code example, indeed.\n\nThe [docs for the `Ridge` class](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) are less detailed but the parameter and attribute names, types, and shapes are the same for `X`, `y`, and `coef_`. I can't think of a reason why the logic of how the shapes of `X` and `y` parameters tran...",

But the bad performing configurations could be tried less than k-times. This could decrease the training time/resources when using `GridSearchCV` by about 30% (depending on the variance of the scores).\n\nSo for example a configuration with a score of `0.73` in 1 out of 5 folds can't perform better than a configuration with `[0.99, 0.98, 1.0, 0.96, 0.99]` as scores and therefore the other 4 folds of the former mentioned configuration can be ignored.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nTherefore I propose the following scheme:\n1. Do 1 out of `k` rounds for every configuration.\n2. Do a round for the configuration which scored best in the previous round(s)\n3. If all `k` rounds were applied to a configuration, eliminate all configurations which scores combined with the best possible score for the missing rounds are lower than the best finished score.\n\nStep `3.` can also be applied when a new step is done and the highest possible overall score for this configuration is lower than the overall score of the best finished configuration.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The set-up is as follows: a statistical learning problem with usuall X and y, where y is imbalanced (roughly 1% of ones). I also have costs matrices C (see below).\n\nScikit learn usually offers wights parameters where you can set up weights matching imbalance. So the weights are depending on the target. Assigning weights will transform the log loss into weighted log loss as seen below.\n\n$\\text{Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i) \\right]$\n\n$\\text{Weighted Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{y_i} \\left[ y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i) \\right]$\n\nAs you see the weights $w$ is constant on each classes and only depends on $y_i$. I am generally looking for specifying the weights in terms of errors costs. More specifically, I have costs matrixes C associated with:\n\n- $c_{1,1}$, cost associated with True Positives (correctly identified positives)\n- $c_{0,1}$, cost associated with False Positives (Type 1 error)\n- $c_{1,0}$, cost associated with False Negatives (Type 2 error)\n- $c_{0,0}$, cost associated with True Negatives (correctly identified negatives)\n\nWith three sub-cases:\n\n1) $c_{y_i,1,1}, c_{y_i,0,1}, c_{y_i,1,0}, c_{y_i,0,0}$ depends only on classes, typically I have classifications costs for each classes (8 parameters in total)\n2) $c_{i,1,1}, c_{i,0,1}, c_{i,1,0}, c_{i,0,0}$ depends on instances, so I have four values for each instances.\n3) $c_{i,1,1}, c_{i,0,1}, c_{i,1,0}, c_{i,0,0}$ depends both on instances and models outputs $\\hat{y}_i$. I think the most generic approach would be to take: \n\n```math\nC = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{y}_i* w_i & 0 \\\\\n(\\hat{y}_i-1)*w_i & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n```\n\n$c_{0,1}=c_{1,1}=0$ as we predict the rare event and refuse the relation\n$c_{0,0}=\\hat{y}_i*w_i $ as we accept the relation and charge proportionally to the estimated risk times some instance n...",

      "body": "### Describe the issue linked to the documentation\n\nCurrently the documentation of [NMF](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html), as well as extensions like the [MiniBatchNMF](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchNMF.html) provide useful comments and warnings for beginners. For example, what type of initialization is suited based on whether sparsity is desired etc.\n\nOne thing that is not however addressed is the scale ambiguity of solving NMF. Specifically, if one desires sparsity on one of the matrices, say W, one should make sure the norm of the other matrix, in this case H, is controlled. Otherwise, a trivial solution would be a rescaled version of W and H, where the norm of W is decreased and the norm of H is increased. This would give the same exact (dot-product) output, while reducing both the L1 and L2 norm of the W matrix. If the user doesn't manually inspect the norms of H later, they may be mislead on what is actually happening. They may think that they have a more sparse factorization, whereas for the most part, they have arrived at a similar solution, just that the matrices have been rescaled. This would really hinder the actual sparsity of the factorization. You can also find this issue discussed in the last paragraph on the first page of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06316).\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nI checked the literature and people often choose between doing Projected Gradient Descent (i.e to project the other matrix to a specified norm so that the model doesn't cheat) or doing a norm regularization on the other matrix as well. Since adding PGD would be too much of a change, I think letting the user know and maybe encouraging them to also add a sparsity constraint on the other matrix is the way to go.\n\nI think there should be a simple warning when either one of `alpha_w` or `alpha_h` is enabled while the other is zero.

FWIW, `hasattr` returns `False` before a call to `fit`:\n\n```python\nct = ColumnTransformer([])\nprint(hasattr(ct, \"named_transformers_\"))\n\nct.fit(np.empty((0, 0)))\nprint(hasattr(ct, \"named_transformers_\"))\n```\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\nThis is the first example from the `ColumnTransformer` [class documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html) wrapped in a single-step `Pipeline`:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer\nct = ColumnTransformer(\n    [(\"norm1\", Normalizer(norm='l1'), [0, 1]),\n     (\"norm2\", Normalizer(norm='l1'), slice(2, 4))])\nX = np.array([[0., 1., 2., 2.],\n              [1., 1., 0., 1.]])\n\nPipeline([ct]).fit(X)\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n- No error is raised\n- The result is essentially equivalent to calling `ct.fit(X)`\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nFile [...]/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py:1226, in ColumnTransformer.__getitem__(self, key)\n   1225 try:\n-> 1226     return self.named_transformers_[key]\n   1227 except AttributeError as e:\n\nFile [...]/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py:582, in ColumnTransformer.named_transformers_(self)\n    581 # Use Bunch ob...",

Because the splitters & criterions depend on parameters from the fitting function, there is a need for class support in the process of parameter parsing.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nChecking if the splitter/criterion is a class and constructing it accordingly.

The later allows to specify a map of monotonic rules in `HistGradientBoostingClassifier.monotonic_cst`. But if `SelectKBest` chooses to omit the fields then `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` fails saying the fields in the monotonic rules are missing in the `X`.\n\n**CASE 3:**\n\nThe documentation to `HistGradientBoostingClassifier.min_samples_leaf` says:\n\n> The minimum number of samples per leaf. For small datasets with less than a few hundred samples, it is recommended to lower this value since only very shallow trees would be built.\n\nBut in a fully automated functional \"pipelined\" trainer how would I know the dataset is small beforehand?\n\n**CASE 4:**\n\nI know I don't want to lose time on checking too small or to big learning rates if the set of features selected by `SelectKBest` has or has not some specific fields. Or the training set itself has or has not some features. \n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nRight now the documentation says: \"param_grid: dict or list of dictionaries\"\n\nscikit-learn needs to allow to specify a callback for `param_grid` as:\n\n```\ndef param_grid_callback(X, y) -> dict or list of dictionaries\n   ...\n```\n\nwhich will be called before `fit()`\n\nIf it is possible for the \"CASE 1\" I would be able to do that (considering the `X` is a Pandas dataframe):\n``` \ndef param_grid_callback(X, y):\n    rules = {\n        'feature_a': +1,\n        'feature_b': -1,\n    } \n\n    return [\n        {\n            `classifier__monotonic_cst`: [\n                 None,\n                 [rules.get(field, 0) for field in X.colum...",

I have a [prototype implementation of Symmetric NMF](https://github.com/kushalkolar/symmetric-nmf) that I [ported from matlab](https://github.com/dakuang/symnmf). There are 2 main papers on it, the oldest one from 2012 has ~500 citations: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=Symmetric+Nonnegative+Matrix+Factorization&btnG= \n\nSymmetric NMF is useful for clustering graphs and allows for soft clustering where a node may belong to multiple clusters. Example, here node 2 has strong membership to cluster 1 and partial membership to cluster 2. It can be seen as an alternative to Gaussian Mixture Models for soft clustering problems, however SymmNMF works directly with an affinity matrix whereas soft clustering with a GMM would typically require projecting the affinity matrix to some low dimensional space.\n\n![Figure_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/084e0102-c0b6-41f9-bc45-f66691ec5428)\n\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nMerge this implementation into sklearn once I've tested that it's robust and reliable: https://github.com/kushalkolar/symmetric-nmf \n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

However, due to the numerical instabilities intrinsic to floating point arithmetic, they might end up being tiny negative numbers that reg_covar must compensate.\nIt turns out that, for some input float32 , the covariance can reach the unreasonable value of -0.99999979.\nThis is because squaring float32 numbers significantly magnifies their precision errors.\n\nThe proposed solution consists in converting float32 values to float64 before squaring them.\nCare must be taken to not increase memory consumption in the overall process.\nHence, as avgX_means is equal to avg_means2, the return value can be simplified.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\n\nmodel = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, covariance_type=\"spherical\", reg_covar=0.1)\nmodel.fit(np.array([[9999.0], [0.0]], dtype=np.float32))\nmodel.covariances_\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n```python\narray([0.1, 0.1])\n```\n\n### Actual Results\n\n```python\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [132], in <cell line: 49>()\n     45 skgm._estimate_gaussian_covariances_diag = _optimized_estimate_gaussian_covariances_diag\n     48 model = GaussianMixture(n_components=2,covariance_type=\"spherical\", reg_covar=0.1)\n---> 49 model.fit(np.array([[9999.0], [0.0]], dtype=np.float32))\n     50 model.covariances_\n\nFile [~\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python39\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\mixture\\_base.py:200](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/~/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/lib/site-packages/sklearn/mixture/_base.py#line=199), in BaseMixture.fit(self, X, y)\n    174 de...",

It seems that that knowledge is already partially in the tags.\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\n- Maybe scikit-learn could have a table in the user guide with guidelines for each estimator?\n- Maybe scikit-learn could hold more tags? And the table could be built from those tags?",

I take the opportunity to consolidate some of those comments here.\n\nFirst, we use the term \"chance\" that is ambiguous depending of the displays. The term \"baseline\" would probably be better. In addition, I checked and I think we should make an extra effort on the definition of the baseline for each of the type of plot: for ROC curve, the baseline is \"a random classifier assigning the positive class with probability p and the negative class with probability 1 − p\" [1] while for the PR curve, the baseline is derived from the \"always-positive classifier\" where any recall or precision under π should be discarded [1].\n\nIt leads to a second where in the PR curve, we plot the horizontal line derived from the always-positive classifier but we don't discard when recall < π. In this case, as mentioned by @e-pet, it might make sense to show the hyperbolic line of the always-positive classifier instead (cf. Fig. 2 in [1]).\n\n@e-pet feel free to add any other points that you wanted to discuss. Here, I wanted to focus on the one that looks critical and could be addressed.\n\n[1] [Flach, P., & Kull, M.

Quantile regression with quantile=0.5 will optimize for the Median Absolute Error. This would be different from optimizing the MAE when the conditional distribution of the response variable is not symmetrically-distributed.\n\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/46a7c9a5e4fe88dfdfd371bf36477f03498a3390/sklearn/_loss/loss.py#L574-L577\n\n**What I expect**\n- Using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"absolute_error\")` should optimize for the mean of absolute errors.\n- Using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"quantile\", quantile=0.5)` should optimize for the median of absolute errors.\n\n```python\n        if sample_weight is None:\n            return np.mean(y_true, axis=0)\n        else:\n            return _weighted_mean(y_true, sample_weight)\n```\n\n**What happens**\nBoth give the same results\n- Using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"absolute_error\")` optimizes for the median of absolute errors\n- Using `HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"quantile\", quantile=0.5)` optimizes for the median of absolute errors\n\n**Suggested Actions**\n\nIf this is intended behavior:\n- Feel free to close this issue marked as resolved.\n- Kindly add a note in the documentation that \"Absolute Error optimizes for Median Absolute Error, not Mean Absolute Error\" as \"absolute_error\" is not very clear.\n- I would appreciate if there was more explanation regarding on using custom loss functions #21614. This way, we could optimize for Mean Absolute Error, Median Absolute Error, Log Cosh, etc. as per the requirement.\n\n**Note**\nI have tried my best to go through the documentation prior to creating this issue. I am a fresh graduate in Computer Science, and if you believe this issue is not well-framed due to a misunderstanding of my concepts, kindly advise me and I'll work on it.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\n# Imports\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegress...",

After a quick look at the libsvm C code within sklearn as well as [libsvm's original documentation](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/), this seems to be expected: \"`wi` set the parameter C of class i to weight*C, for C-SVC\".

So we should not use it with a `GridSearchCV` call. Indeed, the BIC score already penalizes the number of parameters depending on the number of data-points in the training set.\n\nInstead, we should call the `GridSearchCV` on the default `.score` method of the GMM estimator, which computes the log-likelihood and is a perfectly fine metric to select the best model on held out data in a CV loop.\n\nNote that we can keep computing the BIC score for all the hparam combinations but we should either do it in a single for loop (without train-test split), e.g.:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nn_samples = 500\nrng = np.random.default_rng(0)\nC = np.array([[0.0, -0.1], [1.7, 0.4]])\ncomponent_1 = rng.normal(size=(n_samples, 2)) @ C  # general\ncomponent_2 = 0.7 * rng.normal(size=(n_samples, 2)) + np.array([-4, 1])  # spherical\nX = np.concatenate([component_1, component_2])\n\nparam_grid = {\n    \"n_components\": np.arange(1, 7),\n    \"covariance_type\": [\"full\", \"tied\", \"diag\", \"spherical\"],\n}\n\nbic_evaluations = []\nfor params in ParameterGrid(param_grid):\n    bic_value = GaussianMixture(**params).fit(X).bic(X)\n    bic_evaluations.append({**params, \"BIC\": bic_value})\n\nbic_evaluations = pd.DataFrame(bic_evaluations).sort_values(\"BIC\", ascending=True)\nbic_evaluations.head()\n```\n\nSo in summary I would recommend to:\n\n- update the existing `GridSearchCV` code to use the `scoring=None` default that would use the built-in log-likelihood based model evaluation (averaged on the test sets of the CV loop);\n-...",

      "title": "Error with set_output(transform='pandas') in ColumnTransformer when using OneHotEncoder with sparse output in intermediate steps",
      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\n**Explanation**\n\nUsing the ColumnTransformer with set_output(transform='pandas') raises an error when there is a sparse intermediate output, even if the final output is dense. The error suggests setting sparse_output=False in OneHotEncoder, even though the intermediate sparse output should not impact the final dense output after transformations like TruncatedSVD.\n\n\nThe transformer raises this error even though the final output is dense due to the use of TruncatedSVD, which converts the intermediate sparse output to a dense matrix. The requirement to specify sparse_output=False for OneHotEncoder should not be enforced here, as the final output does not contain sparse data.\n\n**Suggested Fix**\n\nThis check should be modified to allow cases where the final output is dense, regardless of intermediate sparse representations.\n\n\n\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\nimport pandas as pd\n\nds = load_diabetes()\ndf = pd.DataFrame(ds['data'], columns=ds['feature_names'])\n\nct = ColumnTransformer([\n    ('ohe_tsvd', make_pipeline(OneHotEncoder(), TruncatedSVD()), ['sex']),\n    ('mm', MinMaxScaler(), ['age', 'bmi', 'bp', 's1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 's6']),\n]).set_output(transform='pandas')\n\nct.fit_transform(df)\n```\n\n\n### Expected Results\n\npandas DataFrame as follow\n\n\nohe_mm__truncatedsvd0 | ohe_mm__truncatedsvd1 | mm__age | mm__bmi | mm__bp | mm__s1 | mm__s2 | mm__s3 | mm__s4 | mm__s5 | mm__s6\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\n0.0 | 1.0 | 0.666667 | 0.582645 | 0.549296 | 0.294118 | 0.256972 | 0.207792 | 0.282087 | 0.562217 | 0.439394\n1.0 | 0.0 | 0.483333 | 0.148760 | 0.352113 | 0.421569 | 0.306773 | 0.623377 | 0.141044 | 0.222437 | 0.166667\n0.0 | 1.0 | 0.883333 | 0.516529 | 0.436620 | 0.289216 | 0.25896...",

So not raising the warning for them, would be nice in this case.\n\nThe down side is that we might be changing some behavior, which although not affecting the user, the user might rely on it, or they might only be affected very close to the deprecation cycle ends, not giving them much time to react. But if this is the case, they still will have time to react since they get the warning.\n\nWDYT?\n\ncc @StefanieSenger @scikit-learn/core-devs",

Update `build_tools/cirrus/arm_wheel.yml` and `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` to support the new version on `1.X.X` branch\n3. Trigger `.github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml` (`workflow_run`) with a specific python version which will only upload wheels for that python version.\n\nThese are the tasks I see:\n\n- **Required**: Update `.github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml` to accept a specific python version and only upload that python version.\n- **Nice to have, but not required**: `build_tools/cirrus/arm_wheel.yml` and `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` to only build wheels for a specific python version.\n\nCC @lesteve",

This has always worked well. However, more recently there has been a change where the words \"Not working\" were replaced by a \"crying\" emoticon. At first glance, no students in class understand what that means, even younger audiences. I have to magnify it, so they see what it actually is. And when I explain it, they find it awkward. \n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nPossible solutions:\n1) Replace the crying emoticon back with text. It does not have to be \"Not Working\", it could be something else such as \"needs improvement\" or\n2) Replace the crying emoticon with the Hammer and Wrench emoji: https://emojiguide.org/hammer-and-wrench. Add a legend to the picture stating that it means \"not working\", \"needs improvement\", \"more work needed\". At least this emoji would be more emotionally neutral and would not be perceived as \"awkward\".\n3) At least add a legend explaining that the crying emoticon means \"not working\", \"needs improvement\", \"more work needed\".",

That's indeed the case for the `csr`, `csc`, `lil` and `dok` formats but it raises errors for the `bsr`, `coo`, `dia` formats because those are not \"subscriptable\". \n\nAs a possible fix, we could validate sparse input data by using `accept_sparse=(\"csr\", \"csc\", \"lil\", \"dok\")` which will then convert to a \"subscriptable\" sparse format.

Could you confirm if scikit-learn's non-metric MDS implementation uses this definition, or if it employs an alternative method?\n\nMetric MDS: Does metric MDS in scikit-learn also optimize for Kruskal Stress, or does it use a different stress formula? If a different approach is used, would it be possible to provide some insight or references on the stress function applied here?\n\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\n\nDocumentation Clarification: It would be incredibly helpful if the documentation could include specific details on the stress formulas used in both metric and non-metric MDS. This addition would help researchers and users better understand the theoretical underpinnings of the algorithm in scikit-learn.\nThank you very much for your guidance and clarification on these points.

I've seen here and there people writing blog posts stating for example that a ColumnTranformer applies steps sequentially : \"a Column Transformer, [like a pipeline], will first apply transformer_1 to Column1, then apply transformer_2 to the transformed version of Column1, and so on\". \n\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nMaybe adding some kind of drawings (either using generic \"feature1\", \"feature2\" - or using maybe a toy dataset) to demonstrate how they handle features and corresponding steps, making visually explicit that the whole input dataset in passed and applied sequentially in a Pipeline, versus the way features and transformers are mapped in ColumnTransformer and FeatureUnion.\n\nI've jotted down a proof of concept of drawings (using [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for instance) that I find usefull as a support for explaining their differences.\n\n<img width=\"492\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f6f692-bef4-4735-96f1-99b5c1afc1ec\">\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e107be0-e6f9-4687-82a4-4b5d438ba0f7\">\n<img width=\"572\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc571481-dcfa-4dce-96e2-ab...",

Before, we simply put [ENH] or [MNT] in front of the changelog entries, we were allowed to deviate from them if needed, and the changes were not sortable by these categories. Now they are much more prominent and we cannot use different ones (or at least the documentation suggests that we cannot).\n\nMajor concerns:\n1. `api` will always be affected with `major-feature` and `feature` and maybe `enhancement`. It is ambiguous for us where to put these and possibly confusing to users.\n2. There is not really a good place to put maintenance PRs and people would probably put them into `enhancement` (which it is not) and `fix` (which it is not).\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\nDiscuss which (non-overlapping) categories are needed/wanted.",

However, the code uses the best estimator's `inlier_mask_best` for the final estimator.\n\n### Actual Results\n\nThe best estimator:\n\n```python\nestimator.coef_\narray([0.03249012], dtype=float32)\nestimator.intercept_\n-0.0016712397\n```\n\nThe final estimator:\n\n```python\nestimator.coef_\narray([0.03334882], dtype=float32)\nestimator.intercept_\n-0.0047605336\n```\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    python: 3.10.9 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb  2 2023, 20:20:04) [GCC 11.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\n   machine: Linux\n\nPython dependencies:\n      sklearn: 1.5.2\n          pip: 24.2\n   setuptools: 75.1.0\n        numpy: 1.26.4\n        scipy: 1.13.0\n       Cython: None\n       pandas: 2.1.1\n   matplotlib: 3.5.3\n       joblib: 1.4.2\nthreadpoolctl: 3.5.0\n\nBuilt with OpenMP: True\n\nthreadpoolctl info:\n       user_api: openmp\n   internal_api: openmp\n    num_threads: 8\n         prefix: libgomp\n       filepath: /opt/conda/lib/libgomp.so.1.0.0\n        version: None\n\n       user_api: blas\n   internal_api: mkl\n    num_threads: 4\n         prefix: libmkl_rt\n       filepath: /opt/conda/lib/libmkl_rt.so.2\n        v...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nThis change aims to improve the architectural design of `partial_fit` classes validation by separating the validation logic from state modification. This will make the code more maintainable and follow better the single responsibility principle.\n\nCurrently, `_check_partial_fit_first_call` both validates classes and modifies the classifier's state by setting `classes_`. This creates a hidden side effect that's not immediately obvious inside of the classifier.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nSplit the current `_check_partial_fit_first_call` into a new validation function that only handles validation and returns the necessary information, letting the classifier handle its own state modification:\n```python\ndef _validate_partial_fit_classes(clf, classes=None):\n    \"\"\"Validates classes parameter for partial_fit without modifying state.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: (is_first_call: bool, validated_classes: ndarray or None)\n    \"\"\"\n    if getattr(clf, \"classes_\", None) is None:\n        if classes is None:\n            raise ValueError(\"classes must be passed on the first call to partial_fit.\")\n        return True, unique_labels(classes)\n        \n    if classes is not None:\n        validated_classes = unique_labels(classes)\n        if not np.array_equal(clf.classes_, validated_classes):\n            raise ValueError(\n                f\"`classes={classes!r}` is not the same as on last call \"\n                f\"to partial_fit, was: {clf.classes_!r}\"\n            )\n    \n    return False, None\n```\n\nThis allows classifiers to use it like:\n\n```python\ndef partial_fit(self, X, y, classes=None):\n    is_first_call, validated_classes = _validate_partial_fit_classes(self, classes)\n    \n    if is_first_call:\n        self.classes_ = validated_classes\n        \n    # Rest of partial_fit implementation...\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis change:\n- Is backwards compatibl...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nCurrently, there is no included implementation of a PCA algorithm made for handling binary data in the scikit-learn library. However, the algorithm for \"logistic PCA\" is well founded, although different methods for its estimation exist, and it meets the inclusion criteria of being at least 3 years since first publication, having over 200 citations between known papers, and has a wide use and usefulness. The proposed implementation follows that of Lee et al. (2010), which allows for the use of an optional L1 regularization term. The intent is to create a `LogisticPCA` implementation that mimics the existing `SparsePCA` implementation to the greatest degree possible acknowledging their important differences, and which utilizes the adopted best practices to fit within the existing matrix decomposition algorithms and the current API of scikit-learn.\n\nReferences\n\nTipping, Michael E. \"Probabilistic visualisation of high-dimensional binary data.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (1999): 592-598.\n\nLee, Seokho, Jianhua Z.

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWhen all data instances come from the same class, #27412 changed the behaviour of `roc_auc_score` to return `0.0` instead of raising an exception. The argument for the change was the consistency with PR curves. I believe that this result is incorrect, or, at least, not correct under all interpretations. Even if only the latter: it is not worth breaking backwards compatibility for a change that is a matter of discussion - in particular if the change is masking an error by returning a (dubious) \"default\".\n\n### Arguments\n\nThe issue arises when all data instances belong to the same class. While AUC is, literally, the area under the ROC curve, we interpret it as the score reflecting the quality of ranking, which is also related to the Gini index and Mann-Whitney U-statistics, as also described in sklearn documentation.\n\n- Under geometric interpretation, if all data comes from the same class, the curve may go either straight right or straight up, depending upon the class, so it can be either 0 or 1 (or 0.5), not (necessarily) 0.0.\n- Under statistical interpretation, the AUC is undefined. AUC is *the probability that for a random pair of instances from different classes, the score assigned to the instance from the positive class is higher than the score assigned to the instance from the negative class*. This measure cannot be computed for data from a single class and is thus undefined. The function should return `np.nan` or raise an exception (as it used to).\n- Furthermore (and related to the previous point), for any `y_true` and `y_score`, it holds that\n\n```python\n    auc(y_true, y_score) \\\n    == auc(1 - y_true, 1 - y_score) \\\n    == 1 - auc(y_true, 1 - y_score) \\\n    == 1 - auc(1 - y_true, y_score)\n```\n\nFlipping either labels or scores reverses the curve and the AUC, and flipping both keeps AUC the same. Before #27412, `auc_roc_score` returned an exception when the result cannot be computed. Now it returns 0.0, which leads to inconsistency when fli...",

This poses challenges when processing large scale classification problems for which the full training set might not fit in memory. \n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nImplementing partial_fit would allow users to train the LDA model incrementally, updating the model with batches of data as they become available.  This is consistent with the existing scikit-learn API, which currently supports this functionality for various other models such as the Naive Bayes classifiers.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nIt may prove to be difficult to support all possible solvers and functionality (e.g.., shrinkage).  As an alternative, an IncrementalLinearDiscriminantAnalysis classifier could be introduced that doesn't support all of the LInearDiscriminantAnalysis parameter options.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI've implemented a basic extension of the current LinearDiscriminantAnalysis classifier that accomplishes this, and am willing to do the development.",

That is, the used for stopping and reported with verbose \"loss\" value doesn't accout for the full model formula/regularization. Also, pay attention to bias term to gauge convergence.\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/c7839c48363d1531af9a00abfcb9d911ecfcb2b2/sklearn/linear_model/_sgd_fast.pyx.tp#L482\nThe optimization almost always stops after 6 epochs, the initial epoch, plus the 5 for stopping tolerance (can't change the number of epochs for the stopping tolerance btw).\nThe problem does not manifest with toy data(small dimensiaonal), becasue 6 epochs is likely enough for convergence to satisfactory solution.\nIn the reproduction code, mind the console output and comments.

The error occurs with the `c` and `ls` arguments.\n\nThe reason is that in `scikit-learn/sklearn/metrics/_plot/roc_curve.py`, the following code exists:\n\n```python\nchance_level_line_kw = {\n    \"label\": \"Chance level (AUC = 0.5)\",\n    \"color\": \"k\",\n    \"linestyle\": \"--\",\n}\n\nif chance_level_kw is not None:\n    chance_level_line_kw.update(**chance_level_kw)\n```\n\nMatplotlib raises an error when both `color` and `c`, or `linestyle` and `ls` are specified (this happens with other arguments too, but these are not relevant here since scikit-learn does not set values for them).\n\nThis behavior may also occur with other future classes, especially `CapCurveDisplay` (in development #28972). \n\nA quick fix might look like this:\n\n```python\nif 'ls' in chance_level_kw:\n    chance_level_kw['linestyle'] = chance_level_kw['ls']\n    del chance_level_kw['ls']\n\nif 'c' in chance_level_kw:\n    chance_level_kw['color'] = chance_level_kw['c']\n    del chance_level_kw['c']\n\nchance_level_line_kw = {\n    \"label\": \"Chance level (AUC = 0.5)\",\n    \"color\": \"k\",\n    \"linestyle\": \"--\",\n}\n\nif chance_level_kw is not None:\n    chance_level_line_kw.update(**chance_level_kw)\n```\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\ndisplay = metrics.RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions(\n    y_true=[0, 0, 1, 1],\n    y_pred=[0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8],\n    plot_chance_level=True,\n    chance_level_kw={'ls': '--'}\n)\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-06 at 15 18 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb409ce3-910e-4a49-91a5-c061156482fb)\n\n\n### Actual Results\n\n`TypeError: Got both 'linestyle' and 'ls', which are aliases of one another`\n\n### Versions\n\n```shell\nSystem:\n    python: 3.12.5 (main, Aug  6 2024, 19:08:49) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)]\nexecutable: /Use...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nCurrently, using `.predict_proba()` for multioutput predictions returns a list of `np.ndarray`, consisting of 2D arrays of shape `(n_samples, 2)`, with probabilities of class 0 and 1. This is quite surprising, since in all other cases pure `np.ndarray` is returned. This also makes reshaping the output inconvenient, requiring a call to `np.array()`.\n\nFor example, to get positive class probabilities, e.g. to compute multioutput AUROC, I have to do (typing for clarity):\n```\npreds: list[np.ndarray] = clf.predict_proba(X_test)\npreds: np.ndarray = np.array(preds)\ny_score = preds[:, :, 1].T\n```\n\nOnly then the resulting `y_score` has shape `(n_samples, n_tasks)`, with predicted class 1 probability in columns.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nReturn `np.ndarray` instead of list of arrays in the multioutput case. Just calling `np.array()` internally would be enough.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nIt could also be nice to include a utility function to extract positive class probabilities. `y_score = preds[:, :, 1].T` is quite non-obvious transformation, while also being necessary in practice to compute column-wise metrics based on probability.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI also found another bug caused by the current implementation.

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nCurrently, `train_test_split` supports stratified sampling for classification problems using the stratify parameter to ensure that the proportion of classes in the training and test sets is balanced. However, there is no equivalent functionality for regression problems, where the distribution of the target variable can be unevenly split between the training and test sets. This can lead to biased models, especially when the target variable follows a skewed or non-uniform distribution.\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a `balance_regression` parameter to `train_test_split` that allows for maintaining a similar distribution of the target variable in both the training and test sets for regression tasks. The goal is to ensure that the train/test split better reflects the underlying distribution of the target variable in regression problems, improving the generalization of models trained on these splits.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nThe solution is to modify the current implementation of `train_test_split` by adding an optional `balance_regression` parameter. When enabled, this parameter will discretize the target variable into quantiles (or bins) using `pd.qcut`, and then apply stratified sampling based on these quantiles to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is consistent across both training and test sets.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\nAdd the balance_regression parameter to `train_test_split`, with a default value of `False`.\nWhen `balance_regression=True`, use `pd.qcut` to divide the target variable into `n_bins` quantiles.\nUse the stratified sampling mechanism based on these quantiles to perform the train/test split.\nEnsure that the existing functionality for classification with stratify remains unaffected, and that `balance_regression` applies only to regression problems.\nThe feature will help users maintain a balanced target variable distribution when splitting datasets in regression problems, en...",

We run automated unit tests in Azure DevOps pipelines on both Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu 22.04.1. All the tests pass on Windows. On Python 3.12.6 in Linux the test with the stacktrace shown below fails with:\n\n`RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast`\n\nThis causes the test and hence build to fail because we set `PYTHONWARNINGS=error` before running the tests. On Python 3.11.10 in Linux this test actually passes; but a different test using the same custom estimator fails with an identical stacktrace. And yet this latter test passes on Python 3.12 in Linux!\n\nNote this change in numpy 1.24.0: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.24.0-notes.html#numpy-now-gives-floating-point-errors-in-casts;  especially this bit:\n\n> The precise behavior is subject to the C99 standard and its implementation in both software and hardware.\n\nI can probably work around this error in our tests by using a [numpy.errstate](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.errstate.html#numpy-errstate) context manager, but could there be a bug in sklearn?\n\nI don't know if this issue is related to #25319.

      "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nIt is known that random forrest regression (as well as many decision tree-based methods) are not affected by the scale of the data and don't require any scaling in the feature matrix or response vector. This includes all types of scaling, like standard normalization (remove the mean, divide by the standard deviation) as well as simple scale scaling (constant multiplication or general linear transformations). \n\nHowever, here there is an example where the absolute scale drastically affects the performance of random forest. Just by multiplying the response by a small number, the performance drastically falls. I am pretty sure this is associated to numerical errors, but notice that the scale factor is not close to machine epsilon. \n\n**Note: ** I actually found this example by first noticing that RF was drastically failing with my scientific data, and fixing it by rescaling the response vector to more reasonable values. This is of course a very simple solution, but I can imagine many users having similar problems and not being able to find this fix given that this should not be required. \n\nI am more than happy to help fixing this bug, but I wanted to documented it first and check with the developers first in case there is something I am missing. \n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```py\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\n\nnp.random.seed(666)\nn, p = 1000, 10\n\n# Generate some feature matrix\nX = np.random.normal(size=(n,p))\n# Generate some simple feature response to predict\nY = 0.5 * X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] + np.random.normal(scale=0.1, size=(n,))\n\n# This breaks at scales ~ 1e-5\nresponse_scale_X = 1\n# For response scale smaller than 1e-8 the prediction breaks\nresponse_scale_Y = 1e-8\n\n# Multiply response and/or feature by a numerical constant\nX *= response_scale_X\nY *= response_scale_Y\n\nmodel_rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_e...",

Here is the current text:\n\n\n> Parameters passed to the `fit` method of the estimator, the scorer, and the CV splitter.\n> \n> If a fit parameter is an array-like whose length is equal to `num_samples` then it will be split across CV groups along with `X` and `y`. For example, the [sample_weight](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/glossary.html#term-sample_weight) parameter is split because `len(sample_weights) = len(X)`.\n\nI was worried that this meant that `grid_search.fit(X, y, groups=g)` would split `g` up across the CV partitions, which is definitely not the right behavior. The correct behavior is to pass the `groups` parameter unchanged to the CV splitter, e.g. `cv.split(X, y, groups=groups)`. I read through the source code and it does appear that the `groups` parameter will get passed through unchanged to `split`, so it looks like the behavior is correct. But we could use something in the docstring that clarifies this behavior.\n\n### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\n\n_No response_",

That means that each sample in my dataset was used to train 3 of the four models. Thus, if I want to get a prediction for a given sample, I need to use the one model that was not trained with that particular sample. \n\nHowever, when I train my models and I get the four pickle files, I cannot pick the right model in an out-of-the-box way. I.e. there is no way to tell which model was not trained with that specific sample.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nThe models could be loaded in some sort of model interface, whiich would take care of picking the right model for the prediction:\n\n```python\ndf_feat = _get_features()\nmodel_wrapper = load_models('/path/to/models/model*.pkl')\nl_prob = mode_wrapper.predict_proba(df_feat)\n```\n\nThis would mean that the model would have to somehow know that a given feature was used to train it, like:\n\n```python\nprob = None\nfor model in l_model:\n    if model.used_feature(sr_feat):\n        continue\n\n    prob=model.predict_proba(sr_feat)\n```\n\nWhich would mean that the model would get pretty large, unless each feature gets stored in a sort of short way within the model. E.g. storing some sort of hash for the whole training dataset as an attribute.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nI can implement this myself using derived classes, a hash check. However it would be good to have it done upstream, or maybe it already exists?\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe way I understand this is done in the real world is that cross validation is used to validate the model against overtraining. Once the model is validated, one trains the model again with the whole dataset, instead of e.g. 75% of it as in the example above. Thus one uses only one model instead of 4.\n\nHowever in particle physics, people do not like to use a model trained with sample `S1` to make predictions for sample `S1`.

Here are the two I had in mind:\n\n### cv=\"prefit\"\n\nFor the cv case, users pass a frozen estimator directly into cv:\n\n```python\nrf = RandomForestClassifer()\nrf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nfrozen_rf = FrozenEstimator(rf)\n\ncalibration = CalibratedClassifierCV(frozen_rf)\ncalibration.fit(X_calib, y_calib)\n```\n\nMaking this change will simplify our codebase with `cv=\"prefit\"`\n\n### compose.Pipeline\n\nWe introduce a new `compose.Pipeline` which follows our conventions with `clone`. (The current `pipeline.Pipeline` does not clone.)\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.compose import Pipeline\n\nprep = ColumnTransformer(...)\nprep.fit(X_train, y_train)\nfrozen_prep = FrozenEstimator(prep)\n\npipe = Pipeline([frozen_prep, LogisticRegression()])\n\npipe.fit(X_another, y_another)\n```\n\n---\n\nIn both cases, I like prefer the semantics of `FrozenEstimator`.",

Similarly, when I use MultiOutputClassifier with RandomForestClassifier, I do not encounter any errors with np.nan values.\nHowever, when I use ClassifierChain, I receive an error during hyperparameter tuning.\nSince the base estimator can handle np.nan values, I expected ClassifierChain to pass the data through without additional checks. It seems inconsistent that ClassifierChain does not support missing values when the base estimator does. \nI'm wondering if this is the intended behavior of ClassifierChain.

A much better, natural baseline in such cases is a lagged series value or the mean of the series over a recent window.\n\nI would love to see a **Dummy strategy tailored for time series**, as sensible baselines are critical in these tasks to avoid optimistic bias.\n\nMoreover, all Dummy estimators are currently simple and extremely fast, giving us room to add more intelligent strategies. What’s not very convenient in the current implementation is that it requires the user to manually test all simple strategies and choose the strongest to establish a reasonable baseline (which is something I always end up doing in practice).\n\nI think we can relieve users of this burden by introducing a **\"best\" strategy that internally evaluates all existing strategies** and returns the best one based on the provided scoring method.\n\nWith these additions, we’ll make Dummy estimators smarter and more useful, capable of highlighting weak user solutions early on.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n1)The typical runtime will increase from ~1/100th of a second to ~1/10th of a second, which I believe is negligible compared to the runtime of main models (usually minutes, if not hours);\n2) A few new parameters added (namely, 4).\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1) We’ll cover the important use case of time series, making baselines more realistic.\n2) We’ll improve user experience by reducing the amount of code required, while offering stronger baselines with strategy=\"best\".\n3) No deprecation of parameters or breaking changes.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\n0) We assume that the target y can either be a NumPy array or a Pandas Series with a datetime-like index.\n1) We provide users the ability to specify a desired window when it's a time series problem...",

However, this will result in duplicate code. \n\nIf it where up to me, there would be a class __stochasticProcessRegressor_ that GPs and TPs would both inherit from. This would minimize duplicate code and make integrating other stochastic processes (eg Gamma Processes) more straight forward. However, this architecture change would complicate an eventual pull request. \n\nI am interested to hear peoples thoughts on implementing TPs and the pros and cons of the two architectures. \n\nT-Process Background:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4306</div>",

Is there a reason for this?\n\nThis can cause a class that inherits from `ColumnTransformer` to display unintuitive behavior.  Suppose someone decides to override the `fit` method in a child class of `ColumnTransformer`.  If they call `fit_transform` on an object of that class, `fit_transform` will just ignore the user's new implementation of the `fit` method.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps this is a contrived example that will never actually be implemented in anyone's workflow, but this example class hits a `RecursionError` when fit:\n```\nclass ColumnTransformer_Child(ColumnTransformer):\n\n   def fit(self, X, y=None):\n       return super().fit(X, y)\n  \n   def transform(self, X):\n       return super().transform(X)\n  \n   def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):\n       return self.fit(X).transform(X)\n```",

I have already implemented support for most of the models in your library and would like to extend this support to the HistGradientBoostingClassifier and HistGradientBoostingRegressor.\n\nHowever, I am encountering difficulties in interpreting the data stored in tree_model._predictors[0][0].nodes. I have reviewed the documentation but could not find detailed explanations for the meaning of each column in this structure.\n\nWhile I have inferred the purpose of most columns, I would like to ensure that I fully understand what each column represents and whether any of them have been transformed by the model.

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nCurrently `KNeighborsRegressor.predict()` accepts `None` as input, in which case it returns prediction for all samples in the training set based on the nearest neighbors not including the sample itself (consistent with `NearestNeighbors` behavior). However, `KNeighborsClassifier.predict()` does not accept `None` as input. This is inconsistent and should arguably be harmonized:\n\n```Python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, KNeighborsRegressor, NearestNeighbors\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = np.random.normal(size=(10, 5))\ny = np.random.normal(size=(10, 1))\n\nknn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3)\nknn.fit(X)\nknn.kneighbors() # works\n\nknn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=3)\nknn.fit(X, y)\nknn.predict(None) # works (NB: does not work without \"None\")\n\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\nknn.fit(X, np.ravel(y) > 0)\nknn.predict(None) # fails with an error\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nMy proposed solution is to make `KNeighborsClassifier.predict(None)` behave the same as `KNeighborsRegressor.predict(None)`. As explained in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27747, the necessary fix requires changing only two lines of code.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nAs explained in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27747, this would be a great feature, super useful and convenient for computing LOOCV accuracy simply via `score(None, y)`. Using `score(X, y)` where `X` is the training set used in `fit(X)` gives a biased result because each (training set) sample gets included into its own neighbors.",

      "body": "It would be great to get the scikit-learn Array API back-end to be compatible with MLX (which is mostly conformant with the array API). \n\nHere is an example which currently does not work for a few reasons:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn import config_context\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nimport mlx.core as mx\n\nX_np, y_np = make_classification(random_state=0)\nX_mx = mx.array(X_np)\ny_mx = mx.array(y_np)\n\nwith config_context(array_api_dispatch=True):\n    lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()\n    X_trans = lda.fit_transform(X_mx, y_mx)\n\nprint(type(X_trans))\n```\n\nThe reasons it does not work:\n\n- MLX does not have a `float64` data type (similar to PyTorch MPS backend). It's a bit hacky to set `mx.float64 = mx.float32` so maybe good to handle this in the scikit or in a compatibility layer.\n\n- MLX does not support operations with data-dependent output shapes, e.g. [`unique_values`](https://data-apis.org/array-api/2022.12/API_specification/generated/array_api.unique_values.html). Since these are optional in the array API should we attempt to avoid using them in scikit to get maximal compatibility with other frameworks?\n\n- There are still a couple functions missing in MLX like `mx.asarray` and `mx.isdtype` (those are pretty easy for us to add)\n\nRelevant discussion in MLX https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/pull/1289\n\nCC @betatim",

In these cases, adding a degree of freedom by using a t distribution instead of a normal distribution can make fitting significantly simpler and easier.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nIn 2000, Peel & McLachlan published [Robust mixture modelling using the t distribution](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/pm_sc00.pdf). This paper is the basis of [an unmaintained GitHub repo](https://github.com/omritomer/student_mixture) containing an implementation that utilizes the existing scikit-learn `BaseMixture` class infrastructure but is somewhat out of date. With some minor changes, that code in this repo has been extremely helpful with fitting some particularly noisy datasets that I need to routinely handle. It seems like this the sort of thing that would also be useful to others, especially since it fits wells into the current scikit-learn design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'd be happy to develop a PR to integrate the `student_mixture` code into the scikit-learn codebase, but I thought it would be a good idea to get feedback before starting that work.",

I actually discovered the bug using the lazy [`ndonnx`](https://github.com/Quantco/ndonnx/tree/main/ndonnx) package, but it does not serve well as a reproducer here since I also run into other, earlier, issues related to eager data validation.\n\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nimport array_api_strict as xp\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn\n\ndef test_minmax_scaler_clip():\n    feature_range = (0, 1)\n    # test behaviour of the parameter 'clip' in MinMaxScaler\n    # X = iris.data\n    X = np.array([[-1, 2], [-0.5, 6], [0, 10], [1, 18]])\n    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=feature_range, clip=True).fit(X)\n    X_min, X_max = np.min(X, axis=0), np.max(X, axis=0)\n    X_test = xp.asarray([np.r_[X_min[:2] - 10, X_max[2:] + 10]])\n    X_transformed = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n\nwith sklearn.config_context(array_api_dispatch=True):\n    test_minmax_scaler_clip()\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n\nI expected that `MinMaxScaler.transform` would just work with a standard compliant implementation.\n\n### Actual Results\n\nThe `array-api-strict` package is lagging behind and fails with the notice that `cli...",

      "body": "### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion on [#22574](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22574) about introducing a new estimator named `ColumnwiseNB`, which aims to handle different types of features by applying different Naive Bayes models column-wise. This approach is promising for datasets that contain a mix of categorical, binary, and continuous variables, each of which might require a different probabilistic approach for effective classification.\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB, GaussianNB, CategoricalNB\n\nclf = ColumnwiseNB(nb_estimators=[('gnb1', GaussianNB(), [0, 1]),\n                                  ('bnb2', BernoulliNB(), [2]),\n                                  ('cnb1', CategoricalNB(), [3, 4])])\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nclf.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nWhile scikit-learn is considering the `ColumnwiseNB` as a potential addition, I've developed a similar feature for a while called `GeneralNB` in the [wnb](https://github.com/msamsami/weighted-naive-bayes) Python package. This class also supports different distributions for each feature, providing flexibility in handling a variety of data types within a Naive Bayes framework. I would like to introduce the community to this already-implemented solution to gather feedback, comments, and suggestions. Understanding whether `GeneralNB` could serve as a good alternative or complementary solution to `ColumnwiseNB` could be beneficial for both scikit-learn developers and users looking for advanced Naive Bayes functionalities.\n\n```python\nfrom wnb import GeneralNB, Distribution as D\n\ngnb = GeneralNB(\n    distributions=[D.NORMAL, D.NORMAL, D.BERNOULLI, D.CATEGORICAL, D.CATEGORICAL])\ngnb.fit(X_train, y_train)\ngnb.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nThis solution fully adheres to scikit-learn's API and supports the following continuous and discrete distributions at the moment of writing this issue:\n- Normal\n- Lognormal\n- Exponential\n...",

However, users might apply the PowerTransformer on hundreds of features at once, and perhaps the situation described below could raise a warning?\n\nHello,  \nI'm trying to test how a Yeo-Johnson transformation might affect a model I'm working on (however, this issue is related to standardization rather than to the Yeo-Johnson transformation itself).  \nFor certain features, which aren't well suited for a Yeo-Johnson or Box-Cox transformation, the algorithm returns extremely similar values (when standardize=False), with differences only in the last few significant digits. This is consistent with scipy's `yeojohnson` and behaving as intended. However, then the standardization (standardize=True) can either yield unexpected results, or not, depending on small differences in the original data. \n\nIn one of such cases, the standardization (standardize=True) returns values that maintain the original trend, but are very small, in the order of 10^-17. This behavior of the standardization algorithm is very sensitive to minimal differences in the original data, as if I change just a 4.62 value to 4.61, it succeeds and creates a standardized array with a reasonable value range, I would say masking these very small differences in the original transformed array; while sometimes it doesn't succeed and yields a standardized array with values of ~10^-17, as mentioned above.  \nFurthermore, when the standardized data is in the 10^-17 range, even MinMaxScaler can't scale properly these values, which remain in the order of 10^-17.   \n\n\n\n\nI have included a simple array of 10 observations that can reproduce the issue.  \n\nIn the example, the initial value ...",

This makes buildtype=debugoptimized a bit confusing since it is actually almost never used, so should be use `buildtype=release` instead? For it to be used you would need to do `meson setup` + `ninja` manually which happens super rarely in a scikit-learn context.\n\nContrast this with most other projects that historically (my crude understanding at least) use out-of-tree build i.e. for example `spin build` + set `PYTHONPATH` when doing `spin test` (although some of the developers use editable installs for example because better integration into IDE/editors I think).\n\nFor these other projects, it may make sense to have developer build in debugoptimized mode and let `meson-python` build in release for wheels.

Therefore, these functions are terribly slow, especially for computationally expensive user-defined metrics. I understand that the reasons for the threading backend are possibly large memory demands and data communication overhead but I suggest a different approach. Also, the documentation for these functions talks about parallel execution and processes which is currently simply not true.\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nThe memory and data communication issues can be reduced by a smarter distribution of the input data to individual processes. Right now, only `Y` is sliced in the `_parallel_pairwise` function which is suboptimal for parallel processing. Both `X` and `Y` should be sliced to lower the demands for multiprocessing. For example for 100x100 `X` and `Y` distributed to 100 processes, we have to copy 100+1 inputs to every process when slicing only `Y` while only 10+10 when slicing both `X` and `Y`. As a result, multiprocessing can be allowed. Also, joblib does automatic memmapping in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, at least the documentation for  `pairwise_kernels` and `pairwise_distances` should be corrected.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

In this case, it will fallback **automatically** on CPU and raise a warning.\n\nHowever, for the following model:\n\n```\nmodel = make_pipeline(PCA(svd_solver=\"covariance_eigh\"), Ridge(solver=\"svd\"))\n```\n\nPyTorch will call `eigh` but this is also not supported for the MPS backend. However, in this case, scikit-learn is raising an error and request to explicitly set the environment variable `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK`.\n\nThis is slightly weird that we are to consistent on how to treat those similar cases. We should check what is the reason and decide if we prefer to raise a warning or an error.",
