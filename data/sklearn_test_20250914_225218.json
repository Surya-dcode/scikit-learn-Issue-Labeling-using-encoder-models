As the number of NaNs increases, imputation becomes less trustworthy, so I implemented my own class to remove features with a large number of NaNs. The inspiration for this were the drug variables from the Human Connectome project. Many of the 1200 subjects simply did not take any hard drugs, so we have a large number of NaNs in the those variables. ### Describe your proposed solution Implement a new class in [CODE].

The pandas team for example now recommends to their contributors to do this after each fetch and merge from [CODE]: [URL] ### Suggest a potential alternative\/fix I think the best place to make a note about this is here in the \"Note\" box under point 7: [URL] Similar to the pandas documentation, it could be recommended here to run [CODE] after each fetch and merge (or pull) from [CODE]. Additionally, it could be recommended to run [CODE] in case people run into unexpected errors after pulling from [CODE].",

There are several gitter channels and a discord instance with several channels. Combined with a (perceived) lack of a clear answer to \"Where should I go for my synchronous communication?\" this leads to lots of channels that appear \"empty\" at first glance (think \"curse of high dimensions\"). To make matters worse, if a venue appears empty people will try new\/other venues to reach the people they are trying to reach. Which further increases the possible venues, further reducing the probability of observing activity in any one of the venues. This topic was discussed at the monthly meeting (28 November 2022) and the feeling was that the status quo is worth improving. There was consensus that reducing (to one) the number of venues would be useful. There was no clear preference for which of the many platforms to select. There are pros and cons to each of them, especially considering the various use cases (sync communication to coordinate repository activity, voice\/video channels for sprints, administrative chat).

However, there is no equivalent functionality for regression problems, where the distribution of the target variable can be unevenly split between the training and test sets. This can lead to biased models, especially when the target variable follows a skewed or non-uniform distribution. This proposal aims to introduce a [CODE] parameter to [CODE] that allows for maintaining a similar distribution of the target variable in both the training and test sets for regression tasks. The goal is to ensure that the train\/test split better reflects the underlying distribution of the target variable in regression problems, improving the generalization of models trained on these splits. ### Describe your proposed solution The solution is to modify the current implementation of [CODE] by adding an optional [CODE] parameter. When enabled, this parameter will discretize the target variable into quantiles (or bins) using [CODE], and then apply stratified sampling based on these quantiles to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is consistent across both training and test sets.

    "text":"Revisit the \"chance level\" for the different displays\n\n@e-pet commented on different PRs & issues some interesting fact. I take the opportunity to consolidate some of those comments here. First, we use the term \"chance\" that is ambiguous depending of the displays. The term \"baseline\" would probably be better. In addition, I checked and I think we should make an extra effort on the definition of the baseline for each of the type of plot: for ROC curve, the baseline is \"a random classifier assigning the positive class with probability p and the negative class with probability 1 \u2212 p\" [1] while for the PR curve, the baseline is derived from the \"always-positive classifier\" where any recall or precision under \u03c0 should be discarded [1]. It leads to a second where in the PR curve, we plot the horizontal line derived from the always-positive classifier but we don't discard when recall < \u03c0. In this case, as mentioned by @e-pet, it might make sense to show the hyperbolic line of the always-positive classifier instead (cf. Fig. 2 in [1]). @e-pet feel free to add any other points that you wanted to discuss. Here, I wanted to focus on the one that looks critical and could be addressed. [1] [Flach, P., & Kull, M. (2015).

    "text":"RFC Should pairwise_distances preserve float32 ?\n\nCurrently the dtype of the distance matrix returned by [CODE] is not very consistent, depending on the metric and on the value of n_jobs. For float64 input, everything is consistent: the returned matrix is always in float64. For mixed float64 X and float32 Y, the return matrix is also always in float64 and this is what should be expected imo. The troubles come when both X and Y are float32. - for sklearn metrics: - [CODE] and [CODE]: result is always float32 - [CODE]: result is float64 if n_jobs=1 and float32 otherwise - for scipy metrics: result is float64 if n_jobs=1 and float32 otherwise Note that scipy cdist\/pdist always returns float64. Hence the question: should [CODE] preserve float32 ? My opinion is that it should since [CODE] can be used as an intermediate step during fit and since there's ongoing work towards preserving float32 in estimators (see [URL] for transfromers for instance). An argument against that could be reducing the numerical instabilities. A potential solution could be to use float64 accumulators for the intermediate computations only, still returning a float32 dist matrix. Note that with [URL] we might not need to use the scipy metrics anymore, in favor of the ones defined in [CODE], and using float64 accumulators would be easier to implement generally.

    "text":"[ENH] Adding KModes and KPrototypes clustering algorithms\n\n### Describe the workflow you want to enable Currently, scikit-learn users working with datasets that contain categorical features (e.g., [CODE], [CODE], [CODE]) face a significant hurdle. The standard practice is to use one-hot encoding before applying algorithms like K-Means. This workflow is problematic because: 1. High-Dimensionality: It drastically increases the dimensionality of the dataset (the \"curse of dimensionality\"). 2. Sparsity: It creates a sparse matrix that is computationally inefficient and poorly suited for distance-based algorithms like K-Means, which are designed for dense, numerical data. 3. Interpretability: The resulting clusters are based on a transformed version of the data, making the centroids and the cluster logic difficult to interpret in terms of the original categorical features. The workflow I want to enable is a seamless and native experience for clustering categorical and mixed data:  For fully categorical data: A user should be able to call [CODE] directly, without any pre-processing.  For mixed data types: A user should be able to call [CODE], where they simply specify which columns are categorical. The algorithm would then automatically use an appropriate dissimilarity measure for each data type. This integrates categorical clustering directly into the robust and familiar scikit-learn API, eliminating the need for external dependencies and inefficient pre-processing. ### Describe y...",

Then I want to find for each of the points of a given cluster the closest point from the other clusters (i.e. excluding itself). ### Describe your proposed solution I would like to pass an extra mask argument (e.g. array of 60k elements) to the query with True for the points in the other clusters and False for the points in the specific cluster. ### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant _No response_ ### Additional context _No response_",

However, when attempting to use a halving search (CODE] or [CODE]) with a PredefinedSplit as cv, the search crashes with the error > sklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'n_samples' parameter of resample must be an int in the range [1, inf) or None.

In the scikit-learn implementation, the validation doesn't allow the fit_transform method of NMF to accept sparse matrixes with NaN values ### Describe your proposed solution - In this file [URL] In the fit_transform method there is code: X = self._validate_data( X, accept_sparse=(\"csr\", \"csc\"), dtype=[np.float64, np.float32] ) - The parameter accept_sparse with (\"csr\", \"csc\") default values will be passed to the check_array method in [URL] so validation accepts a sparse format - But the check_array method has a parameter force_all_finite with a default value of True. And this parameter doesn't allow check_array to accept NaN values even when the sparse format (\"csr\", \"csc\") is allowed - As a result, the method def _assert_all_finite of the validation.py file throws the following error: ValueError(\"Input contains NaN\") Can you make it configurable to add force_all_finite='allow_nan' to the _validate_data method in the fit_transform method of NMF? ### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant _No response_ ### Add...",

Currently, scikit-learn allows users to define custom distance metrics, but there is no built-in support for weighted distance metrics, which are essential when certain features are more important than others. Example Workflow: A user has a dataset where some features are more relevant than others (e.g., in customer segmentation, age and income might be more important than the number of children). The user wants to use a clustering algorithm like KMeans or a nearest neighbors algorithm like KNeighborsClassifier but needs to account for the varying importance of features. The user specifies a vector of weights corresponding to the importance of each feature. The algorithm uses the weighted Euclidean distance metric to compute distances, ensuring that more important features have a greater influence on the results. ### Describe your proposed solution I propose adding a Weighted Euclidean Distance Metric to scikit-learn as a built-in distance metric. This will allow users to specify feature weights directly, making it easier to incorporate feature importance into distance-based algorithms. Key Components of the Solution: 1.

I have encountered an issue where ClassifierChain raises a ValueError when the input data X contains np.nan values, even though RandomForestClassifier can handle np.nan values natively. When I use RandomForestClassifier alone, it processes np.nan values without any problems, thanks to its internal tree splitting mechanism that supports missing values. Similarly, when I use MultiOutputClassifier with RandomForestClassifier, I do not encounter any errors with np.nan values. However, when I use ClassifierChain, I receive an error during hyperparameter tuning. Since the base estimator can handle np.nan values, I expected ClassifierChain to pass the data through without additional checks. It seems inconsistent that ClassifierChain does not support missing values when the base estimator does. I'm wondering if this is the intended behavior of ClassifierChain.

    "text":"Error with set_output(transform='pandas') in ColumnTransformer when using OneHotEncoder with sparse output in intermediate steps\n\n### Describe the bug Explanation Using the ColumnTransformer with set_output(transform='pandas') raises an error when there is a sparse intermediate output, even if the final output is dense. The error suggests setting sparse_output=False in OneHotEncoder, even though the intermediate sparse output should not impact the final dense output after transformations like TruncatedSVD. The transformer raises this error even though the final output is dense due to the use of TruncatedSVD, which converts the intermediate sparse output to a dense matrix. The requirement to specify sparse_output=False for OneHotEncoder should not be enforced here, as the final output does not contain sparse data. Suggested Fix This check should be modified to allow cases where the final output is dense, regardless of intermediate sparse representations. ### Steps\/Code to Reproduce [CODE_BLOCK] ### Expected Results pandas DataFrame as follow ohe_mm__truncatedsvd0 | ohe_mm__truncatedsvd1 | mm__age | mm__bmi | mm__bp | mm__s1 | mm__s2 | mm__s3 | mm__s4 | mm__s5 | mm__s6 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.666667 | 0.582645 | 0.549296 | 0.294118 | 0.256972 | 0.207792 | 0.282087 | 0.562217 | 0.439394 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.483333 | 0.148760 | 0.352113 | 0.421569 | 0.306773 | 0.623377 | 0.141044 | 0.222437 | 0.166667 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.883333 | 0.516529 | 0.436620 ...",

Maybe the intercept should be separated as [CODE]. - [CODE] is a dictionary with class labels as keys and arrays of shape (n_folds, n_cs) or similar as values. All values are the same regardless of the key (class label). This is a relict from OvR.

First, StratifiedGroupKFold sometimes doesn't give ideally stratified splits when shuffle=True. Second, I think I found a general bug where the code just isn't doing what I think is intended when shuffle=True. My main change is something of a \"new feature\", but if this should be instead submitted as a bug report, I can do that. ### Improving the stratification In the below example, StratifiedGroupKFold is working as intended. It gives train\/test splits with identical balances of Y. For this example, there are six groups. For four groups, the an average Y = 0.6, but for two groups the average is Y = 0.4. The train\/test split is 50%\/50% so the ideal split has train Y = 0.533 and test Y = 0.533 (two groups from the Y = 0.6 and one from Y = 0.4). However, when random_state=0 is changed to random_state=15, it no longer gives perfectly balanced splits. For random_state=15, the first fold has average Y = 0.6 and the second fold has average Y = 0.466. We generally want StratifiedGroupKFold to give the most ideal splits possible.

That means that for each query sample, we'd like to query $k$ nearest neighbors, such that $k$ is the minimal integer satisfying $$\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w_i \\ge n$$ where $w_i$ is the weight for the $i$-th nearest neighbor and $n$ is [CODE]. This is more tricky to implement, as we don't know in advance how many neighbors to query, and the number is different for each sample. A reasonable compromise would be to query \"a bit more\" (maybe double?) neighbors than [CODE], and then take only as many neighbors as needed for each sample.

Right now, the prefix is added without any option to turn that functionality off. ### Describe your proposed solution I propose to add the same parameter that exists in [CODE] to [CODE] so that the user can decide whether or not they would like to have the prefix or not. ### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant The user can remove the prefox manually after FeatureUnion has transformed the data Requires to identify the columns in question and remove the prefix. Removing the prefix via a simple [CODE] could cause problems if the feature names already include [CODE]. If that is the case a more complicated way to remove the prefix is required by the user. The user can write their own implementation of FeatureUnion that changes the method in question [CODE_BLOCK] Adds more code to the user's codebase that needs to be maintai...",
